%X Aging is the single largest risk factor for most chronic diseases, and thus possesses large socioeconomic interest to continuously aging societies. Consequently, the field of aging research is expanding alongside a growing focus from the industry and investors in aging research. This year's 8th Annual Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) meeting was organized as a hybrid meeting from August 30th to September 3rd 2021 with more than 130 attendees participating on-site at the Ceremonial Hall at University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and 1800 engaging online. The conference comprised of presentations from 75 speakers focusing on new research in topics including mechanisms of aging and how these can be modulated as well as the use of AI and new standards of practices within aging research. This year, a longevity workshop was included to build stronger connections with the clinical community.

%X Cytomegalovirus (CMV) latent infection and aging contribute to alterations in the function and phenotype of the T-cell pool. We have demonstrated that CMV-seropositivity is associated with the expansion of polyfunctional CD57+ T-cells in young and middle-aged individuals in response to different stimuli. Here, we expand our results on the effects of age and CMV infection on T-cell functionality in a cohort of healthy middle-aged and older individuals stratified by CMV serostatus. Specifically, we studied the polyfunctional responses (degranulation, IFN-γ and TNF-α production) of CD4+, CD8+, CD8+CD56+ (NKT-like), and CD4-CD8- (DN) T-cells according to CD57 expression in response to Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB). Our results show that CD57 expression by T-cells is not only a hallmark of CMV infection in young individuals but also at older ages. CD57+ T-cells are more polyfunctional than CD57- T-cells regardless of age. CMV-seronegative individuals have no or a very low percentages of cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells (CD1017a+) and CD4+CD57+ T-cells, supporting the notion that the expansion of these T-cells only occurs in the context of CMV infection. There was a functional shift in T-cells associated with CMV seropositivity, except in the NKT-like subset. Here, we show that the effect of CMV infection and age differ among T-cell subsets and that CMV is the major driving force for the expansion of highly polyfunctional CD57+ T-cells, emphasizing the necessity of considering CMV serology in any study of immunosenescence.

%X Genomic profiling revealed the identity of at least 5 subtypes of DLBCL, including the MCD/C5 cluster characterized by aberrations in MYD88, BCL2, PRDM1 and/or SPIB. We generated mouse models harboring B cell-specific Prdm1 or Spib aberrations on the background of oncogenic Myd88 and Bcl2 lesions. We deployed whole exome sequencing, transcriptome, flow- and mass cytometry analyses to demonstrate that Prdm1- or Spib-altered lymphomas display molecular features consistent with pre-memory B cells and light zone B cells, whereas lymphomas lacking these alterations were enriched for late light-zone and plasmablast-associated gene sets. Consistent with the phenotypic evidence for increased B cell receptor signaling activity in Prdm1-altered lymphomas, we demonstrate that combined BTK/BCL2 inhibition displays therapeutic activity in mice and in five out of six relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. Moreover, Prdm1-altered lymphomas were immunogenic upon transplantation into immuno-competent hosts, displayed an actionable PD-L1 surface expression and were sensitive to anti-murine-CD19-CAR-T cell therapy, in vivo.

%X Changes in splicing fidelity are associated with loss of homeostasis and aging, yet only a handful of splicing factors have been shown to be causally required to promote longevity, and the underlying mechanisms and downstream targets in these paradigms remain elusive. Surprisingly, we found a hypomorphic mutation within ribonucleoprotein RNP-6/poly(U)-binding factor 60 kDa (PUF60), a spliceosome component promoting weak 3′-splice site recognition, which causes aberrant splicing, elevates stress responses and enhances longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Through genetic suppressor screens, we identify a gain-of-function mutation within rbm-39, an RNP-6-interacting splicing factor, which increases nuclear speckle formation, alleviates splicing defects and curtails longevity caused by rnp-6 mutation. By leveraging the splicing changes induced by RNP-6/RBM-39 activities, we uncover intron retention in egl-8/phospholipase C β4 (PLCB4) as a key splicing target prolonging life. Genetic and biochemical evidence show that neuronal RNP-6/EGL-8 downregulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling to control organismal lifespan. In mammalian cells, PUF60 downregulation also potently and specifically inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Altogether, our results reveal that splicing fidelity modulates lifespan through mTOR signaling.

%X Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic that functions as an immunosuppressive and anti-cancer agent, and displays robust anti-ageing effects in multiple organisms including humans. Importantly, rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are of clinical importance against certain cancer types and neurodevelopmental diseases. Although rapamycin is widely perceived as an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), the master regulator of cellular and organismal physiology, its specificity has not been thoroughly evaluated so far. In fact, previous studies in cells and in mice suggested that rapamycin may be also acting independently from mTOR to influence various cellular functions. Here, we generated a gene-edited cell line, that expresses a rapamycin-resistant mTOR mutant (mTORRR), and assessed the effects of rapamycin treatment on the transcriptome and proteome of control or mTORRR-expressing cells. Our data reveal a striking specificity of rapamycin towards mTOR, demonstrated by virtually no changes in mRNA or protein levels in rapamycin-treated mTORRR cells, even following prolonged drug treatment. Overall, this study provides the first comprehensive and conclusive assessment of rapamycin’s specificity, with important potential implications for ageing research and human therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

%X Cell growth is regulated primarily by the mammalian/mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) that functions both as a nutrient sensor and a master controller of virtually all biosynthetic pathways 1. This ensures that cells are metabolically active only when conditions are optimal for growth. Notably, although mTORC1 is known to regulate fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, how and whether the cellular lipid biosynthetic capacity signals back to fine-tune mTORC1 activity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mTORC1 senses the capacity of a cell to synthesize FAs by detecting the levels of malonyl-CoA, an intermediate of this biosynthetic pathway. We find that, in both yeast and mammalian cells, this regulation is very direct, with malonyl-CoA binding to the mTOR catalytic pocket and acting as a specific ATP-competitive inhibitor. When ACC1 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1) is hyperactive or FASN (fatty acid synthase) is downregulated/inhibited, elevated malonyl-CoA levels are channelled to proximal mTOR molecules that form direct protein-protein interactions with ACC1 and FASN. Our findings represent a conserved, unique, homeostatic mechanism whereby impaired FA biogenesis leads to reduced mTORC1 activity to coordinatively link this metabolic pathway to the overall cellular biosynthetic output. Moreover, they reveal the first-described example of a physiological metabolite that directly inhibits the activity of a signalling kinase by competing with ATP for binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

%X Energy is essential for all cellular functions in a living organism. How cells coordinate their physiological processes with energy status and availability is thus an important question. The turnover of actin cytoskeleton between its monomeric and filamentous forms is a major energy drain in eukaryotic cells. However, how actin dynamics are regulated by ATP levels remain largely unknown in plant cells. Here, we observed that seedlings with impaired functions of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), either by mutation of the key component, RAPTOR1B, or inhibition of TOR activity by specific inhibitors, displayed reduced sensitivity to actin cytoskeleton disruptors compared to their controls. Consistently, actin filament dynamics, but not organization, were suppressed in TORC1-impaired cells. Subcellular localization analysis and quantification of ATP concentration demonstrated that RAPTOR1B localized at cytoplasm and mitochondria and that ATP levels were significantly reduced in TORC1-impaired plants. Further pharmacologic experiments showed that the inhibition of mitochondrial functions led to phenotypes mimicking those observed in raptor1b mutants at the level of both plant growth and actin dynamics. Exogenous feeding of adenine could partially restore ATP levels and actin dynamics in TORC1-deficient plants. Thus, these data support an important role for TORC1 in coordinating ATP homeostasis and actin dynamics in plant cells.

%X Cytochrome c oxidase is a pivotal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which sustains bioenergetics of eukaryotic cells. Cox12, a peripheral subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, is required for full activity of the enzyme, but its exact function is unknown. Here, experimental evolution of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Deltacox12 strain for approximately 300 generations allowed to restore the activity of cytochrome c oxidase. In one population, the enhanced bioenergetics was caused by a A375V mutation in the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104. Deletion or overexpression of HSP104 also increased respiration of the Deltacox12 ancestor strain. This beneficial effect of Hsp104 was related to the loss of the [PSI(+)] prion, which forms cytosolic amyloid aggregates of the Sup35 protein. Overall, our data demonstrate that cytosolic aggregation of a prion impairs the mitochondrial metabolism of cells defective for Cox12. These findings identify a new functional connection between cytosolic proteostasis and biogenesis of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

%X Bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in a hypoxic niche that maintains their differentiation potential. While hypoxia (low oxygen concentration) was reported to critically support stem cell function and osteogenesis, the molecular events triggering changes in stem cell fate decisions in response to normoxia (high oxygen concentration) remain elusive. Here, we study the impact of normoxia on mitochondrial-nuclear communication during stem cell differentiation. We show that normoxia-cultured murine MSCs undergo profound transcriptional alterations which cause irreversible osteogenesis defects. Mechanistically, high oxygen promotes chromatin compaction and histone hypo-acetylation, particularly on promoters and enhancers of osteogenic genes. Although normoxia induces metabolic rewiring resulting in elevated acetyl-CoA levels, histone hypo-acetylation occurs due to the trapping of acetyl-CoA inside mitochondria owing to decreased citrate carrier (CiC) activity. Restoring the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool remodels the chromatin landscape and rescues the osteogenic defects. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the metabolism-chromatin-osteogenesis axis is perturbed upon exposure to high oxygen levels and identifies CiC as a novel, oxygen-sensitive regulator of the MSC function.

%X In animal models, single-gene mutations in genes involved in insulin/IGF and target of rapamycin signalling pathways extend lifespan to a considerable extent. The genetic, genomic and epigenetic influences on human longevity are expected to be much more complex. Strikingly however, beneficial metabolic and cellular features of long-lived families resemble those in animals for whom the lifespan is extended by applying genetic manipulation and, especially, dietary restriction. Candidate gene studies in humans support the notion that human orthologues from longevity genes identified in lower species do contribute to longevity but that the influence of the genetic variants involved is small. Here we discuss how an integration of novel study designs, labour-intensive biobanking, deep phenotyping and genomic research may provide insights into the mechanisms that drive human longevity and healthy ageing, beyond the associations usually provided by molecular and genetic epidemiology. Although prospective studies of humans from the cradle to the grave have never been performed, it is feasible to extract life histories from different cohorts jointly covering the molecular changes that occur with age from early development all the way up to the age at death. By the integration of research in different study cohorts, and with research in animal models, biological research into human longevity is thus making considerable progress.

%X By studying the loci that contribute to human longevity, we aim to identify mechanisms that contribute to healthy aging. To identify such loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comparing 403 unrelated nonagenarians from long-living families included in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) and 1670 younger population controls. The strongest candidate SNPs from this GWAS have been analyzed in a meta-analysis of nonagenarian cases from the Rotterdam Study, Leiden 85-plus study, and Danish 1905 cohort. Only one of the 62 prioritized SNPs from the GWAS analysis (P<1x10(-4) ) showed genome-wide significance with survival into old age in the meta-analysis of 4149 nonagenarian cases and 7582 younger controls [OR=0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.77), P=3.39 x 10(-17) ]. This SNP, rs2075650, is located in TOMM40 at chromosome 19q13.32 close to the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Although there was only moderate linkage disequilibrium between rs2075650 and the ApoE epsilon4 defining SNP rs429358, we could not find an APOE-independent effect of rs2075650 on longevity, either in cross-sectional or in longitudinal analyses. As expected, rs429358 associated with metabolic phenotypes in the offspring of the nonagenarian cases from the LLS and their partners. In addition, we observed a novel association between this locus and serum levels of IGF-1 in women (P=0.005). In conclusion, the major locus determining familial longevity up to high age as detected by GWAS was marked by rs2075650, which tags the deleterious effects of the ApoE epsilon4 allele. No other major longevity locus was found.

%X Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become an effective therapy to treat obstructive coronary artery diseases (CAD). However, one of the major drawbacks of PCI is the occurrence of restenosis in 5-25% of all initially treated patients. Restenosis is defined as the re-narrowing of the lumen of the blood vessel, resulting in renewed symptoms and the need for repeated intervention. To identify genetic variants that are associated with restenosis, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in 295 patients who developed restenosis (cases) and 571 who did not (controls) from the GENetic Determinants of Restenosis (GENDER) study. Analysis of ~550 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GENDER was followed by a replication phase in three independent case-control populations (533 cases and 3067 controls). A potential susceptibility locus for restenosis at chromosome 12, including rs10861032 (P(combined) = 1.11 x 10(-7)) and rs9804922 (P(combined) = 1.45 x 10(-6)), was identified in the GWAS and replication phase. In addition, both SNPs were also associated with coronary events (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.005; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.023) in a trial based cohort set of elderly patients with (enhanced risk of) CAD (PROSPER) and all-cause mortality in PROSPER (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.007; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.013) and GENDER (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.005; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.023). Further analysis suggests that this locus could be involved in regulatory functions.

%X In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits, single SNP analysis is still the most applied approach. However, the identified SNPs have small effects and provide limited biological insight. A more appropriate approach to interpret GWAS data of complex traits is to analyze the combined effect of a SNP set grouped per pathway or gene region. We used this approach to study the joint effect on human longevity of genetic variation in two candidate pathways, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) pathway and the telomere maintenance (TM) pathway. For the analyses, we used genotyped GWAS data of 403 unrelated nonagenarians from long-lived sibships collected in the Leiden Longevity Study and 1,670 younger population controls. We analyzed 1,021 SNPs in 68 IIS pathway genes and 88 SNPs in 13 TM pathway genes using four self-contained pathway tests (PLINK set-based test, Global test, GRASS and SNP ratio test). Although we observed small differences between the results of the different pathway tests, they showed consistent significant association of the IIS and TM pathway SNP sets with longevity. Analysis of gene SNP sets from these pathways indicates that the association of the IIS pathway is scattered over several genes (AKT1, AKT3, FOXO4, IGF2, INS, PIK3CA, SGK, SGK2, and YWHAG), while the association of the TM pathway seems to be mainly determined by one gene (POT1). In conclusion, this study shows that genetic variation in genes involved in the IIS and TM pathways is associated with human longevity.

%X Genotype imputation has become an essential tool in the analysis of genome-wide association scans. This technique allows investigators to test association at ungenotyped genetic markers, and to combine results across studies that rely on different genotyping platforms. In addition, imputation is used within long-running studies to reuse genotypes produced across generations of platforms. Typically, genotypes of controls are reused and cases are genotyped on more novel platforms yielding a case-control study that is not matched for genotyping platforms. In this study, we scrutinize such a situation and validate GWAS results by actually retyping top-ranking SNPs with the Sequenom MassArray platform. We discuss the needed quality controls (QCs). In doing so, we report a considerable discrepancy between the results from imputed and retyped data when applying recommended QCs from the literature. These discrepancies appear to be caused by extrapolating differences between arrays by the process of imputation. To avoid false positive results, we recommend that more stringent QCs should be applied. We also advocate reporting the imputation quality measure (R(T)(2)) for the post-imputation QCs in publications.

%X The Leiden Longevity Study consists of families that express extended survival across generations, decreased morbidity in middle-age, and beneficial metabolic profiles. To identify which pathways drive this complex phenotype of familial longevity and healthy aging, we performed a genome-wide gene expression study within this cohort to screen for mRNAs whose expression changes with age and associates with longevity. We first compared gene expression profiles from whole blood samples between 50 nonagenarians and 50 middle-aged controls, resulting in identification of 2,953 probes that associated with age. Next, we determined which of these probes associated with longevity by comparing the offspring of the nonagenarians (50 subjects) and the middle-aged controls. The expression of 360 probes was found to change differentially with age in members of the long-lived families. In a RT-qPCR replication experiment utilizing 312 controls, 332 offspring and 79 nonagenarians, we confirmed a nonagenarian specific expression profile for 21 genes out of 25 tested. Since only some of the offspring will have inherited the beneficial longevity profile from their long-lived parents, the contrast between offspring and controls is expected to be weak. Despite this dilution of the longevity effects, reduced expression levels of two genes, ASF1A and IL7R, involved in maintenance of chromatin structure and the immune system, associated with familial longevity already in middle-age. The size of this association increased when controls were compared to a subfraction of the offspring that had the highest probability to age healthily and become long-lived according to beneficial metabolic parameters. In conclusion, an "aging-signature" formed of 21 genes was identified, of which reduced expression of ASF1A and IL7R marked familial longevity already in middle-age. This indicates that expression changes of genes involved in metabolism, epigenetic control and immune function occur as a function of age, and some of these, like ASF1A and IL7R, represent early features of familial longevity and healthy ageing.

%X The single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2866164, in the MTP gene, has been associated with human longevity but has not been validated by subsequent longevity studies. Using our population of Ashkenazi Jews, we find that the MTP CC genotype is significantly overrepresented in centenarians and their offspring, as compared with controls (p < .05). However, when we examined MTP CC genotype frequency pattern with aging, we observed a monotonic decline between ages 55-85 years followed by a dramatic enrichment after age 90 years, forming a U-shape pattern (p < .05). Furthermore, the MTP CC genotype was buffered by three validated longevity genotypes (p < .05). This buffering effect was found to confer an enrichment of the MTP CC genotype in centenarians, whereas their absence in CC controls resulted in poorer survivorship (p < .05). Thus, we conclude that MTP CC is a buffered-deleterious genotype and that assessing genotype frequency across aging is essential for discerning longevity from buffered-deleterious genotypes.

%X mTOR signalling is implicated in the development of disease and in lifespan extension in model organisms. This pathway has been associated with human diseases such as diabetes and cancer, but has not been investigated for its impact on longevity per se. Here, we investigated whether transcriptional variation within the mTOR pathway is associated with human longevity using whole-blood samples from the Leiden Longevity Study. This is a unique cohort of Dutch families with extended survival across generations, decreased morbidity and beneficial metabolic profiles in middle-age. By comparing mRNA levels of nonagenarians and middle-aged controls, the mTOR signalling gene set was found to associate with old age (P = 4.6 x 10(-7)). Single gene analysis showed that seven of 40 mTOR pathway genes had a significant differential expression of at least 5%. Of these, the RPTOR (Raptor) gene was found to be differentially expressed also when the offspring of nonagenarians was compared with their spouses, indicating association with familial longevity in middle-age. This association was not explained by variation between the groups in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cancer or glucose levels. Thus, the mTOR pathway not only plays a role in the regulation of disease and aging in animal models, but also in human health and longevity.

%X Clear evidence exists for heritability of human longevity, and much interest is focused on identifying genes associated with longer lives. To identify such longevity alleles, we performed the largest genome-wide linkage scan thus far reported. Linkage analyses included 2118 nonagenarian Caucasian sibling pairs that have been enrolled in 15 study centers of 11 European countries as part of the Genetics of Healthy Aging (GEHA) project. In the joint linkage analyses, we observed four regions that show linkage with longevity; chromosome 14q11.2 (LOD = 3.47), chromosome 17q12-q22 (LOD = 2.95), chromosome 19p13.3-p13.11 (LOD = 3.76), and chromosome 19q13.11-q13.32 (LOD = 3.57). To fine map these regions linked to longevity, we performed association analysis using GWAS data in a subgroup of 1228 unrelated nonagenarian and 1907 geographically matched controls. Using a fixed-effect meta-analysis approach, rs4420638 at the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 gene locus showed significant association with longevity (P-value = 9.6 x 10(-8) ). By combined modeling of linkage and association, we showed that association of longevity with APOEepsilon4 and APOEepsilon2 alleles explain the linkage at 19q13.11-q13.32 with P-value = 0.02 and P-value = 1.0 x 10(-5) , respectively. In the largest linkage scan thus far performed for human familial longevity, we confirm that the APOE locus is a longevity gene and that additional longevity loci may be identified at 14q11.2, 17q12-q22, and 19p13.3-p13.11. As the latter linkage results are not explained by common variants, we suggest that rare variants play an important role in human familial longevity.

%X Telomere length (TL) has been associated with aging and mortality, but individual differences are also influenced by genetic factors, with previous studies reporting heritability estimates ranging from 34 to 82%. Here we investigate the heritability, mode of inheritance and the influence of parental age at birth on TL in six large, independent cohort studies with a total of 19,713 participants. The meta-analysis estimate of TL heritability was 0.70 (95% CI 0.64-0.76) and is based on a pattern of results that is highly similar for twins and other family members. We observed a stronger mother-offspring (r=0.42; P-value=3.60 x 10(-61)) than father-offspring correlation (r=0.33; P-value=7.01 x 10(-5)), and a significant positive association with paternal age at offspring birth (beta=0.005; P-value=7.01 x 10(-5)). Interestingly, a significant and quite substantial correlation in TL between spouses (r=0.25; P-value=2.82 x 10(-30)) was seen, which appeared stronger in older spouse pairs (mean age >/=55 years; r=0.31; P-value=4.27 x 10(-23)) than in younger pairs (mean age<55 years; r=0.20; P-value=3.24 x 10(-10)). In summary, we find a high and very consistent heritability estimate for TL, evidence for a maternal inheritance component and a positive association with paternal age.

%X Thyroid hormone is essential for normal metabolism and development, and overt abnormalities in thyroid function lead to common endocrine disorders affecting approximately 10% of individuals over their life span. In addition, even mild alterations in thyroid function are associated with weight changes, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders. To identify novel variants underlying thyroid function, we performed a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for serum levels of the highly heritable thyroid function markers TSH and FT4, in up to 26,420 and 17,520 euthyroid subjects, respectively. Here we report 26 independent associations, including several novel loci for TSH (PDE10A, VEGFA, IGFBP5, NFIA, SOX9, PRDM11, FGF7, INSR, ABO, MIR1179, NRG1, MBIP, ITPK1, SASH1, GLIS3) and FT4 (LHX3, FOXE1, AADAT, NETO1/FBXO15, LPCAT2/CAPNS2). Notably, only limited overlap was detected between TSH and FT4 associated signals, in spite of the feedback regulation of their circulating levels by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Five of the reported loci (PDE8B, PDE10A, MAF/LOC440389, NETO1/FBXO15, and LPCAT2/CAPNS2) show strong gender-specific differences, which offer clues for the known sexual dimorphism in thyroid function and related pathologies. Importantly, the TSH-associated loci contribute not only to variation within the normal range, but also to TSH values outside the reference range, suggesting that they may be involved in thyroid dysfunction. Overall, our findings explain, respectively, 5.64% and 2.30% of total TSH and FT4 trait variance, and they improve the current knowledge of the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function and the consequences of genetic variation for hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

%X Human lifespan variation is mainly determined by environmental factors, whereas the genetic contribution is 25-30% and expected to be polygenic. Two complementary fields go hand in hand in order to unravel the mechanisms of biological aging: genomic and biomarker research. Explorative and candidate gene studies of the human genome by genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic approaches have resulted in the identification of a limited number of interesting positive linkage regions, genes, and pathways that contribute to lifespan variation. The possibilities to further exploit these findings are rapidly increasing through the use of novel technologies, such as next-generation sequencing. Genomic research is progressively being integrated with biomarker studies on aging, including the application of (noninvasive) deep phenotyping and omics data - generated using novel technologies - in a wealth of studies in human populations. Hence, these studies may assist in obtaining a more holistic perspective on the role of the genome in aging and lifespan regulation.

%X PURPOSE: DNA repair deficiencies have been postulated to play a role in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The hypothesis is that DNA damage accumulating with age may induce cell death, which promotes formation of unstable plaques. Defects in DNA repair mechanisms may therefore increase the risk of CVD events. We examined whether the joints effect of common genetic variants in 5 DNA repair pathways may influence the risk of CVD events. METHODS: The PLINK set-based test was used to examine the association to myocardial infarction (MI) of the DNA repair pathway in GWAS data of 866 subjects of the GENetic DEterminants of Restenosis (GENDER) study and 5,244 subjects of the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) study. We included the main DNA repair pathways (base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)) in the analysis. RESULTS: The NHEJ pathway was associated with the occurrence of MI in both GENDER (P = 0.0083) and PROSPER (P = 0.014). This association was mainly driven by genetic variation in the MRE11A gene (PGENDER = 0.0001 and PPROSPER = 0.002). The homologous recombination pathway was associated with MI in GENDER only (P = 0.011), for the other pathways no associations were observed. CONCLUSION: This is the first study analyzing the joint effect of common genetic variation in DNA repair pathways and the risk of CVD events, demonstrating an association between the NHEJ pathway and MI in 2 different cohorts.

%X Interindividual variation in mean leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with cancer and several age-associated diseases. We report here a genome-wide meta-analysis of 37,684 individuals with replication of selected variants in an additional 10,739 individuals. We identified seven loci, including five new loci, associated with mean LTL (P < 5 x 10(-8)). Five of the loci contain candidate genes (TERC, TERT, NAF1, OBFC1 and RTEL1) that are known to be involved in telomere biology. Lead SNPs at two loci (TERC and TERT) associate with several cancers and other diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, a genetic risk score analysis combining lead variants at all 7 loci in 22,233 coronary artery disease cases and 64,762 controls showed an association of the alleles associated with shorter LTL with increased risk of coronary artery disease (21% (95% confidence interval, 5-35%) per standard deviation in LTL, P = 0.014). Our findings support a causal role of telomere-length variation in some age-related diseases.

%X The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) promotes glucose homeostasis and enhances beta-cell function. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which inhibit the physiological inactivation of endogenous GLP-1, are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Using the Metabochip, we identified three novel genetic loci with large effects (30-40%) on GLP-1-stimulated insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamps in nondiabetic Caucasian individuals (TMEM114; CHST3 and CTRB1/2; n = 232; all P </= 8.8 x 10(-7)). rs7202877 near CTRB1/2, a known diabetes risk locus, also associated with an absolute 0.51 +/- 0.16% (5.6 +/- 1.7 mmol/mol) lower A1C response to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment in G-allele carriers, but there was no effect on GLP-1 RA treatment in type 2 diabetic patients (n = 527). Furthermore, in pancreatic tissue, we show that rs7202877 acts as expression quantitative trait locus for CTRB1 and CTRB2, encoding chymotrypsinogen, and increases fecal chymotrypsin activity in healthy carriers. Chymotrypsin is one of the most abundant digestive enzymes in the gut where it cleaves food proteins into smaller peptide fragments. Our data identify chymotrypsin in the regulation of the incretin pathway, development of diabetes, and response to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment.

%X It has been postulated that aging is the consequence of an accelerated accumulation of somatic DNA mutations and that subsequent errors in the primary structure of proteins ultimately reach levels sufficient to affect organismal functions. The technical limitations of detecting somatic changes and the lack of insight about the minimum level of erroneous proteins to cause an error catastrophe hampered any firm conclusions on these theories. In this study, we sequenced the whole genome of DNA in whole blood of two pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins, 40 and 100 years old, by two independent next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms (Illumina and Complete Genomics). Potentially discordant single-base substitutions supported by both platforms were validated extensively by Sanger, Roche 454, and Ion Torrent sequencing. We demonstrate that the genomes of the two twin pairs are germ-line identical between co-twins, and that the genomes of the 100-year-old MZ twins are discerned by eight confirmed somatic single-base substitutions, five of which are within introns. Putative somatic variation between the 40-year-old twins was not confirmed in the validation phase. We conclude from this systematic effort that by using two independent NGS platforms, somatic single nucleotide substitutions can be detected, and that a century of life did not result in a large number of detectable somatic mutations in blood. The low number of somatic variants observed by using two NGS platforms might provide a framework for detecting disease-related somatic variants in phenotypically discordant MZ twins.

%X BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte telomere length (LTL) decreases with age and shorter LTL has previously been associated with increased prospective mortality. However, it is not clear whether LTL merely marks the health status of an individual by its association with parameters of immune function, for example, or whether telomere shortening also contributes causally to lifespan variation in humans. METHODS: We measured LTL in 870 nonagenarian siblings (mean age 93 years), 1580 of their offspring and 725 spouses thereof (mean age 59 years) from the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS). RESULTS: We found that shorter LTL is associated with increased prospective mortality in middle (30-80 years; hazard ratio (HR)=0.75, P=0.001) and highly advanced age (>/=90 years; HR=0.92, P=0.028), and show that this association cannot be explained by the association of LTL with the immune-related markers insulin-like growth factor 1 to insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 molar ratio, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, cytomegalovirus serostatus or white blood cell counts. We found no difference in LTL between the middle-aged LLS offspring and their spouses (beta=0.006, P=0.932). Neither did we observe an association of LTL-associated genetic variants with mortality in a prospective meta-analysis of multiple cohorts (n=8165). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm LTL to be a marker of prospective mortality in middle and highly advanced age and additionally show that this association could not be explained by the association of LTL with various immune-related markers. Furthermore, the approaches performed here do not further support the hypothesis that LTL variation contributes to the genetic propensity for longevity.

%X The genetic contribution to the variation in human lifespan is approximately 25%. Despite the large number of identified disease-susceptibility loci, it is not known which loci influence population mortality. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 7729 long-lived individuals of European descent (>/= 85 years) and 16 121 younger controls (<65 years) followed by replication in an additional set of 13 060 long-lived individuals and 61 156 controls. In addition, we performed a subset analysis in cases aged >/= 90 years. We observed genome-wide significant association with longevity, as reflected by survival to ages beyond 90 years, at a novel locus, rs2149954, on chromosome 5q33.3 (OR = 1.10, P = 1.74 x 10(-8)). We also confirmed association of rs4420638 on chromosome 19q13.32 (OR = 0.72, P = 3.40 x 10(-36)), representing the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus. In a prospective meta-analysis (n = 34 103), the minor allele of rs2149954 (T) on chromosome 5q33.3 associates with increased survival (HR = 0.95, P = 0.003). This allele has previously been reported to associate with low blood pressure in middle age. Interestingly, the minor allele (T) associates with decreased cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of blood pressure. We report on the first GWAS-identified longevity locus on chromosome 5q33.3 influencing survival in the general European population. The minor allele of this locus associates with low blood pressure in middle age, although the contribution of this allele to survival may be less dependent on blood pressure. Hence, the pleiotropic mechanisms by which this intragenic variation contributes to lifespan regulation have to be elucidated.

%X AIMS: Modulation of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) activity affects insulin secretion in both rodents and isolated pancreatic beta-cells. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the DRD2/ANKK1 locus may affect susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in humans. METHODS: Four potentially functional variants in the coding region of the DRD2/ANKK1 locus (rs1079597, rs6275, rs6277, rs1800497) were genotyped and analysed for type 2 diabetes susceptibility in up to 25 000 people (8148 with type 2 diabetes and 17687 control subjects) from two large independent Dutch cohorts and one Danish cohort. In addition, 340 Dutch subjects underwent a 2-h hyperglycaemic clamp to investigate insulin secretion. Since sexual dimorphic associations related to DRD2 polymorphisms have been previously reported, we also performed a gender-stratified analysis. RESULTS: rs1800497 at the DRD2/ANKK1 locus was associated with a significantly increased risk for type 2 diabetes in women (odds ratio 1.14 (1.06-1.23); P = 4.1*10(4)) but not in men (odds ratio 1.00 (95% CI 0.93-1.07); P = 0.92) or the combined group. Although rs1800497 was not associated with insulin secretion, we did find another single nucleotide polymorphism in this locus, rs6275, to be associated with increased first-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in women (P = 5.5*10(4)) but again not in men (P = 0.34). CONCLUSION: The present data identify DRD2/ANKK1 as a potential sex-specific type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene.

%X Oxidative stress and inflammation are major contributors to accelerated age-related relative telomere length (RTL) shortening. Both conditions are strongly linked to leptin and adiponectin, the most prominent adipocyte-derived protein hormones. As high leptin levels and low levels of adiponectin have been implicated in inflammation, one expects adiponectin to be positively associated with RTL while leptin should be negatively associated. Within the ENGAGE consortium, we investigated the association of RTL with adiponectin and leptin in seven independent cohorts with a total of 11,448 participants. We performed partial correlation analysis on Z-transformed RTL and LN-transformed leptin/adiponectin, adjusting for age and sex. In extended models we adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Adiponectin showed a borderline significant association with RTL. This appeared to be determined by a single study and when the outlier study was removed, this association disappeared. The association between RTL and leptin was highly significant (r = -0.05; p = 1.81 x 10(-7)). Additional adjustment for BMI or CRP did not change the results. Sex-stratified analysis revealed no difference between men and women. Our study suggests that high leptin levels are associated with short RTL.

%X BACKGROUND: The genetic contribution to longevity in humans has been estimated to range from 15% to 25%. Only two genes, APOE and FOXO3, have shown association with longevity in multiple independent studies. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies including 6,036 longevity cases, age >/=90 years, and 3,757 controls that died between ages 55 and 80 years. We additionally attempted to replicate earlier identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with longevity. RESULTS: In our meta-analysis, we found suggestive evidence for the association of SNPs near CADM2 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81; p value = 9.66 x 10(-7)) and GRIK2 (odds ratio = 1.24; p value = 5.09 x 10(-8)) with longevity. When attempting to replicate findings earlier identified in genome-wide association studies, only the APOE locus consistently replicated. In an additional look-up of the candidate gene FOXO3, we found that an earlier identified variant shows a highly significant association with longevity when including published data with our meta-analysis (odds ratio = 1.17; p value = 1.85x10(-10)). CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify new genome-wide significant associations with longevity and did not replicate earlier findings except for APOE and FOXO3. Our inability to find new associations with survival to ages >/=90 years because longevity represents multiple complex traits with heterogeneous genetic underpinnings, or alternatively, that longevity may be regulated by rare variants that are not captured by standard genome-wide genotyping and imputation of common variants.

%X BACKGROUND: The burden of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is associated with an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death. WMH are highly heritable, but their genetic underpinnings are incompletely characterized. To identify novel genetic variants influencing WMH burden, we conducted a meta-analysis of multiethnic genome-wide association studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 21 079 middle-aged to elderly individuals from 29 population-based cohorts, who were free of dementia and stroke and were of European (n=17 936), African (n=1943), Hispanic (n=795), and Asian (n=405) descent. WMH burden was quantified on MRI either by a validated automated segmentation method or a validated visual grading scale. Genotype data in each study were imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference. Within each ethnic group, we investigated the relationship between each single-nucleotide polymorphism and WMH burden using a linear regression model adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume, and principal components of ancestry. A meta-analysis was conducted for each ethnicity separately and for the combined sample. In the European descent samples, we confirmed a previously known locus on chr17q25 (P=2.7x10(-19)) and identified novel loci on chr10q24 (P=1.6x10(-9)) and chr2p21 (P=4.4x10(-8)). In the multiethnic meta-analysis, we identified 2 additional loci, on chr1q22 (P=2.0x10(-8)) and chr2p16 (P=1.5x10(-8)). The novel loci contained genes that have been implicated in Alzheimer disease (chr2p21 and chr10q24), intracerebral hemorrhage (chr1q22), neuroinflammatory diseases (chr2p21), and glioma (chr10q24 and chr2p16). CONCLUSIONS: We identified 4 novel genetic loci that implicate inflammatory and glial proliferative pathways in the development of WMH in addition to previously proposed ischemic mechanisms.

%X Facial pigmented spots are a common skin aging feature, but genetic predisposition has yet to be thoroughly investigated. We conducted a genome-wide association study for pigmented spots in 2,844 Dutch Europeans from the Rotterdam Study (mean age: 66.9+/-8.0 years; 47% male). Using semi-automated image analysis of high-resolution digital facial photographs, facial pigmented spots were quantified as the percentage of affected skin area (mean women: 2.0% +/-0.9, men: 0.9% +/-0.6). We identified genome-wide significant association with pigmented spots at three genetic loci: IRF4 (rs12203592, P=1.8 x 10(-27)), MC1R (compound heterozygosity score, P=2.3 x 10(-24)), and RALY/ASIP (rs6059655, P=1.9 x 10(-9)). In addition, after adjustment for the other three top-associated loci the BNC2 locus demonstrated significant association (rs62543565, P=2.3 x 10(-8)). The association signals observed at all four loci were successfully replicated (P<0.05) in an independent Dutch cohort (Leiden Longevity Study n=599). Although the four genes have previously been associated with skin color variation and skin cancer risk, all association signals remained highly significant (P<2 x 10(-8)) when conditioning the association analyses on skin color. We conclude that genetic variations in IRF4, MC1R, RALY/ASIP, and BNC2 contribute to the acquired amount of facial pigmented spots during aging, through pathways independent of the basal melanin production.

%X Variants associated with blood lipid levels may be population-specific. To identify low-frequency variants associated with this phenotype, population-specific reference panels may be used. Here we impute nine large Dutch biobanks (~35,000 samples) with the population-specific reference panel created by the Genome of The Netherlands Project and perform association testing with blood lipid levels. We report the discovery of five novel associations at four loci (P value <6.61 x 10(-4)), including a rare missense variant in ABCA6 (rs77542162, p.Cys1359Arg, frequency 0.034), which is predicted to be deleterious. The frequency of this ABCA6 variant is 3.65-fold increased in the Dutch and its effect (betaLDL-C=0.135, betaTC=0.140) is estimated to be very similar to those observed for single variants in well-known lipid genes, such as LDLR.

%X BACKGROUND: Observational studies in older subjects have shown no or inverse associations between cholesterol levels and mortality. However, in old age plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may not reflect the lifetime level due to reverse causality, and hence the risk may be underestimated. In the current study, we used an LDL genetic risk score (GRS) to overcome this problem. METHODS: A weighted GRS was created using 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with LDL-C levels. The LDL GRS was calculated in three Dutch cohorts: the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) (n = 3270), the Leiden 85-plus study (n = 316) and the Rotterdam Study (n = 4035). We assessed the association between the LDL GRS and LDL-C levels, chronological age, familial longevity and mortality. RESULTS: Up to 90 years of age, in each age stratum individuals with high LDL GRS had higher LDL-C levels (P = 0.010 to P = 1.1 x 10(-16)). The frequency of LDL-increasing alleles decreased with increasing age [beta = -0.021 (SE = 0.01) per year, P = 0.018]. Moreover, individuals with a genetic predisposition for longevity had significantly lower LDL GRS compared with age-matched individuals of the general population [LLS nonagenarians vs > 90 years: beta = 0.73 (SE = 0.33), P = 0.029, LLS offspring vs partners: beta = 0.66 (SE = 0.23), P = 0.005]. In longitudinal analysis, high GRS was associated with increased all-cause mortality in individuals > 90 years, with a 13% increased risk in individuals with the highest LDL GRS (P-trend = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Results of the current study indicate that a genetic predisposition to high LDL-C levels contributes to mortality throughout life, including in the oldest old, and a beneficial LDL genetic risk profile is associated with familial longevity.

%X Calendar age is the major risk factor for common disease. It is therefore expected that understanding the aging process will eventually lead to promotion of better health conditions in elderly populations. Such insight may be obtained by identifying the genetic determinants of familial and exceptional longevity and age-related disease. Research of these determinants has been performed in candidate gene, genome-wide association and linkage studies. Because exploration of the common variation in the genome did not explain much of the variation in the rate of aging and longevity, researchers in the field have only recently started to investigate the contribution of rare genetic variants to these traits. The increased throughput and decreased costs of next generation sequencing (NGS) have resulted in a great deal of novel applications for sequencing sets of candidate genes, whole exomes, and whole genomes of individuals. Most of the successful NGS applications are as yet those focused on genetic syndromes and cancers for which causal mutations are readily being identified. In this chapter, we discuss the genetic and phenomic aspects of human aging research and the use of NGS data to identify genes relevant for age-related diseases and lifespan regulation, and to investigate the accumulation of somatic genetic variation during the course of life.

%X Using a genome-wide screen of 9.6 million genetic variants achieved through 1000 Genomes Project imputation in 62,166 samples, we identify association to lipid traits in 93 loci, including 79 previously identified loci with new lead SNPs and 10 new loci, 15 loci with a low-frequency lead SNP and 10 loci with a missense lead SNP, and 2 loci with an accumulation of rare variants. In six loci, SNPs with established function in lipid genetics (CELSR2, GCKR, LIPC and APOE) or candidate missense mutations with predicted damaging function (CD300LG and TM6SF2) explained the locus associations. The low-frequency variants increased the proportion of variance explained, particularly for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol. Altogether, our results highlight the impact of low-frequency variants in complex traits and show that imputation offers a cost-effective alternative to resequencing.

%X Reference panels from the 1000 Genomes (1000G) Project Consortium provide near complete coverage of common and low-frequency genetic variation with minor allele frequency >/=0.5% across European ancestry populations. Within the European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE) Consortium, we have undertaken the first large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), supplemented by 1000G imputation, for four quantitative glycaemic and obesity-related traits, in up to 87,048 individuals of European ancestry. We identified two loci for body mass index (BMI) at genome-wide significance, and two for fasting glucose (FG), none of which has been previously reported in larger meta-analysis efforts to combine GWAS of European ancestry. Through conditional analysis, we also detected multiple distinct signals of association mapping to established loci for waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (RSPO3) and FG (GCK and G6PC2). The index variant for one association signal at the G6PC2 locus is a low-frequency coding allele, H177Y, which has recently been demonstrated to have a functional role in glucose regulation. Fine-mapping analyses revealed that the non-coding variants most likely to drive association signals at established and novel loci were enriched for overlap with enhancer elements, which for FG mapped to promoter and transcription factor binding sites in pancreatic islets, in particular. Our study demonstrates that 1000G imputation and genetic fine-mapping of common and low-frequency variant association signals at GWAS loci, integrated with genomic annotation in relevant tissues, can provide insight into the functional and regulatory mechanisms through which their effects on glycaemic and obesity-related traits are mediated.

%X Copy number variants (CNVs) represent a significant source of genetic variation in the human genome and have been implicated in numerous diseases and complex traits. To date, only a few studies have investigated the role of CNVs in human lifespan. To investigate the impact of CNVs on prospective mortality at the extreme end of life, where the genetic component of lifespan appears most profound, we analyzed genomewide CNV data in 603 Danish nonagenarians and centenarians (mean age 96.9 years, range 90.0-102.5 years). Replication was performed in 500 long-lived individuals from the Leiden Longevity Study (mean age 93.2 years, range 88.9-103.4 years). First, we assessed the association between the CNV burden of each individual (the number of CNVs, the average CNV length, and the total CNV length) and mortality and found a significant increase in mortality per 10 kb increase in the average CNV length, both for all CNVs (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.024, P = 0.002) and for duplications (HR = 1.011, P = 0.005), as well as per 100 kb increase in the total length of deletions (HR = 1.009, P = 0.0005). Next, we assessed the relation between specific deletions and duplications and mortality. Although no genome-wide significant associations were discovered, we identified six deletions and one duplication that showed consistent association with mortality in both or either of the sexes across both study populations. These results indicate that the genome-wide CNV burden, specifically the average CNV length and the total CNV length, associates with higher mortality in long-lived individuals.

%X BACKGROUND: The level of expression of the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) gene in blood has recently been found to be associated with familial longevity and healthy ageing. IL7R is crucial for T cell development and important for immune competence. To further investigate the IL7R pathway in ageing, we identified the closest interacting genes to construct an IL7R gene network that consisted of IL7R and six interacting genes: IL2RG, IL7, TSLP, CRLF2, JAK1 and JAK3. This network was explored for association with chronological age, familial longevity and immune-related diseases (type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rheumatoid arthritis) in 87 nonagenarians, 337 of their middle-aged offspring and 321 middle-aged controls from the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS). RESULTS: We observed that expression levels within the IL7R gene network were significantly different between the nonagenarians and middle-aged controls (P = 4.6 x 10(-4)), being driven by significantly lower levels of expression in the elderly of IL7, IL2RG and IL7R. After adjustment for multiple testing and white blood cell composition and in comparison with similarly aged controls, middle-aged offspring of nonagenarian siblings exhibit a lower expression level of IL7R only (P = 0.006). Higher IL7R gene expression in the combined group of middle-aged offspring and controls is associated with a higher prevalence of immune-related disease (P = 0.001). On the one hand, our results indicate that lower IL7R expression levels, as exhibited by the members of long-lived families that can be considered as 'healthy agers', are beneficial in middle age. This is augmented by the observation that higher IL7R gene expression associates with immune-related disease. On the other hand, IL7R gene expression in blood is lower in older individuals, indicating that low IL7R gene expression might associate with reduced health. Interestingly, this contradictory result is supported by the observation that a higher IL7R gene expression level is associated with better prospective survival, both in the nonagenarians (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.63, P = 0.037) and the middle-aged individuals (HR = 0.33, P = 1.9 x 10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we conclude that the IL7R network reflected by gene expression levels in blood may be involved in the rate of ageing and health status of elderly individuals.

%X Animal lifespan is regulated by conserved metabolic signalling pathways and specific transcription factors, but whether these pathways affect common downstream mechanisms remains largely elusive. Here we show that NCL-1/TRIM2/Brat tumour suppressor extends lifespan and limits nucleolar size in the major C. elegans longevity pathways, as part of a convergent mechanism focused on the nucleolus. Long-lived animals representing distinct longevity pathways exhibit small nucleoli, and decreased expression of rRNA, ribosomal proteins, and the nucleolar protein fibrillarin, dependent on NCL-1. Knockdown of fibrillarin also reduces nucleolar size and extends lifespan. Among wildtype C. elegans, individual nucleolar size varies, but is highly predictive for longevity. Long-lived dietary restricted fruit flies and insulin-like-peptide mutants exhibit small nucleoli and fibrillarin expression, as do long-lived dietary restricted and IRS1 knockout mice. Furthermore, human muscle biopsies from individuals who underwent modest dietary restriction coupled with exercise also display small nucleoli. We suggest that small nucleoli are a cellular hallmark of longevity and metabolic health conserved across taxa.

%X Multiple studies have shown that levels of 1H-NMR metabolites are associated with disease and risk factors of disease such as BMI. While most previous investigations have been performed in fasting samples, meta-analysis often includes both cohorts with fasting and non-fasting blood samples. In the present study comprising 153 participants (mean age 63 years; mean BMI 27 kg/m2) we analyzed the effect of a standardized liquid meal (SLM) on metabolite levels and how the SLM influenced the association between metabolites and BMI. We observed that many metabolites, including glycolysis related metabolites, multiple amino acids, LDL diameter, VLDL and HDL lipid concentration changed within 35 minutes after a standardized liquid meal (SLM), similarly for all individuals. Remarkable, however, is that the correlations of metabolite levels with BMI remained highly similar before and after the SLM. Hence, as exemplified with the disease risk factor BMI, our results suggest that the applicability of 1H-NMR metabolites as disease biomarkers depends on the standardization of the fasting status rather than on the fasting status itself. Future studies are required to investigate the dependency of metabolite biomarkers for other disease risk factors on the fasting status.

%X Leptin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone, the circulating levels of which correlate closely with overall adiposity. Although rare mutations in the leptin (LEP) gene are well known to cause leptin deficiency and severe obesity, no common loci regulating circulating leptin levels have been uncovered. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating leptin levels from 32,161 individuals and followed up loci reaching P<10(-6) in 19,979 additional individuals. We identify five loci robustly associated (P<5 x 10(-8)) with leptin levels in/near LEP, SLC32A1, GCKR, CCNL1 and FTO. Although the association of the FTO obesity locus with leptin levels is abolished by adjustment for BMI, associations of the four other loci are independent of adiposity. The GCKR locus was found associated with multiple metabolic traits in previous GWAS and the CCNL1 locus with birth weight. Knockdown experiments in mouse adipose tissue explants show convincing evidence for adipogenin, a regulator of adipocyte differentiation, as the novel causal gene in the SLC32A1 locus influencing leptin levels. Our findings provide novel insights into the regulation of leptin production by adipose tissue and open new avenues for examining the influence of variation in leptin levels on adiposity and metabolic health.

%X Epigenetic remodeling is one of the major features of the aging process. We recently demonstrated that DNA methylation of ELOVL2 and FHL2 CpG islands is highly correlated with age in whole blood. Here we investigated several aspects of age-associated hypermethylation of ELOVL2 and FHL2 We showed that ELOVL2 methylation is significantly different in primary dermal fibroblast cultures from donors of different ages. Using epigenomic data from public resources, we demonstrated that most of the tissues show ELOVL2 and FHL2 hypermethylation with age. Interestingly, ELOVL2 hypermethylation was not found in tissues with very low replication rate. We demonstrated that ELOVL2 hypermethylation is associated with in vitro cell replication rather than with senescence. We confirmed intra-individual hypermethylation of ELOVL2 and FHL2 in longitudinally assessed participants from the Doetinchem Cohort Study. Finally we showed that, although the methylation of the two loci is not associated with longevity/mortality in the Leiden Longevity Study, ELOVL2 methylation is associated with cytomegalovirus status in nonagenarians, which could be informative of a higher number of replication events in a fraction of whole-blood cells. Collectively, these results indicate that ELOVL2 methylation is a marker of cell divisions occurring during human aging.

%X For people in their 40s and 50s, lifestyle programs have been shown to improve metabolic health. For older adults, however, it is not clear whether these programs are equally healthy. In the Growing Old Together study, we applied a 13-weeks lifestyle program, with a target of 12.5% caloric restriction and 12.5% increase in energy expenditure through an increase in physical activity, in 164 older adults (mean age=63.2 years; BMI=23-35 kg/m2). Mean weight loss was 4.2% (SE=2.8%) of baseline weight, which is comparable to a previous study in younger adults. Fasting insulin levels, however, showed a much smaller decrease (0.30 mU/L (SE=3.21)) and a more heterogeneous response (range=2.0-29.6 mU/L). Many other parameters of metabolic health, such as blood pressure, and thyroid, glucose and lipid metabolism improved significantly. Many 1H-NMR metabolites changed in a direction previously associated with a low risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and partially independently of weight loss. In conclusion, 25% reduction in energy balance for 13 weeks induced a metabolic health benefit in older adults, monitored by traditional and novel metabolic markers.

%X Only two genome-wide significant loci associated with longevity have been identified so far, probably because of insufficient sample sizes of centenarians, whose genomes may harbor genetic variants associated with health and longevity. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Han Chinese with a sample size 2.7 times the largest previously published GWAS on centenarians. We identified 11 independent loci associated with longevity replicated in Southern-Northern regions of China, including two novel loci (rs2069837-IL6; rs2440012-ANKRD20A9P) with genome-wide significance and the rest with suggestive significance (P < 3.65 x 10(-5)). Eight independent SNPs overlapped across Han Chinese, European and U.S. populations, and APOE and 5q33.3 were replicated as longevity loci. Integrated analysis indicates four pathways (starch, sucrose and xenobiotic metabolism; immune response and inflammation; MAPK; calcium signaling) highly associated with longevity (P </= 0.006) in Han Chinese. The association with longevity of three of these four pathways (MAPK; immunity; calcium signaling) is supported by findings in other human cohorts. Our novel finding on the association of starch, sucrose and xenobiotic metabolism pathway with longevity is consistent with the previous results from Drosophilia. This study suggests protective mechanisms including immunity and nutrient metabolism and their interactions with environmental stress play key roles in human longevity.

%X BACKGROUND: The rs7903146-T allele in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been associated with impaired pancreatic insulin secretion, enhanced liver glucose production, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, the impact of rs7903146 on daily glucose trajectories remains unclear. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can estimate glycemia and glycemic variability based on consecutive glucose measurements collected over several days. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations of rs7903146 with glycemia and glycemic variability in middle-aged participants without diabetes. METHODS: Complete data from 235 participants without diabetes from the Leiden Longevity Study were available. Participants were divided into two groups based on rs7903146 genotype; rs7903146-CC genotype carriers (N = 123) and rs7903146-CT/TT genotype carriers (N = 112). Validated parameters of glycemia (e.g., mean 24h glucose level) and glycemic variability (e.g., 24h standard deviation) were derived from data collected with a CGM system for a 72-hour period. RESULTS: The study population was on average 64.7 years old (standard deviation = 5.9) and composed of 49.8% of women. Compared with rs7903146-CC carriers, rs7903146-CT/TT carriers exhibited a trend towards a higher mean 24-hour glucose level (5.21 versus 5.32 mmol/L; p-value = 0.15) and a significantly higher mean nocturnal glucose (3:00am- 6:00am; 4.48 versus 4.67 mmol/L; p-value = 0.03) that was explained for 34.6% by body weight and percentage body fat. No differences in measures of glycemic variability between the genotype groups were observed. CONCLUSION: Despite limited sample size, our study indicates that the rs7903146-T allele in TCF7L2 was associated with a higher mean nocturnal glucose dependent on body composition, which might suggest that rs7902146 affects liver-specific aspects of glucose metabolism.

%X Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous loci linked with complex diseases, for which the molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. Comprehensive molecular profiling of circulating metabolites captures highly heritable traits, which can help to uncover metabolic pathophysiology underlying established disease variants. We conduct an extended genome-wide association study of genetic influences on 123 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics from up to 24,925 individuals and identify eight novel loci for amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. The LPA locus link with cardiovascular risk exemplifies how detailed metabolic profiling may inform underlying aetiology via extensive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism. Genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization uncover wide-spread causal effects of lipoprotein(a) on overall lipoprotein metabolism and we assess potential pleiotropic consequences of genetically elevated lipoprotein(a) on diverse morbidities via electronic health-care records. Our findings strengthen the argument for safe LPA-targeted intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk.

%X BACKGROUND: So far, more than 170 loci have been associated with circulating lipid levels through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These associations are largely driven by common variants, their function is often not known, and many are likely to be markers for the causal variants. In this study we aimed to identify more new rare and low-frequency functional variants associated with circulating lipid levels. METHODS: We used the 1000 Genomes Project as a reference panel for the imputations of GWAS data from approximately 60 000 individuals in the discovery stage and approximately 90 000 samples in the replication stage. RESULTS: Our study resulted in the identification of five new associations with circulating lipid levels at four loci. All four loci are within genes that can be linked biologically to lipid metabolism. One of the variants, rs116843064, is a damaging missense variant within the ANGPTL4 gene. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that GWAS with high-scale imputation may still help us unravel the biological mechanism behind circulating lipid levels.

%X Looking young for one's age has been a desire since time immemorial. This desire is attributable to the belief that appearance reflects health and fecundity. Indeed, perceived age predicts survival [1] and associates with molecular markers of aging such as telomere length [2]. Understanding the underlying molecular biology of perceived age is vital for identifying new aging therapies among other purposes, but studies are lacking thus far. As a first attempt, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of perceived facial age and wrinkling estimated from digital facial images by analyzing over eight million SNPs in 2,693 elderly Dutch Europeans from the Rotterdam Study. The strongest genetic associations with perceived facial age were found for multiple SNPs in the MC1R gene (p < 1 x 10(-7)). This effect was enhanced for a compound heterozygosity marker constructed from four pre-selected functional MC1R SNPs (p = 2.69 x 10(-12)), which was replicated in 599 Dutch Europeans from the Leiden Longevity Study (p = 0.042) and in 1,173 Europeans of the TwinsUK Study (p = 3 x 10(-3)). Individuals carrying the homozygote MC1R risk haplotype looked on average up to 2 years older than non-carriers. This association was independent of age, sex, skin color, and sun damage (wrinkling, pigmented spots) and persisted through different sun-exposure levels. Hence, a role for MC1R in youthful looks independent of its known melanin synthesis function is suggested. Our study uncovers the first genetic evidence explaining why some people look older for their age and provides new leads for further investigating the biological basis of how old or young people look.

%X In the field of aging research, family-based sampling study designs are commonly used to study the lifespans of long-lived family members. However, the specific sampling procedure should be carefully taken into account in order to avoid biases. This work is motivated by the Leiden Longevity Study, a family-based cohort of long-lived siblings. Families were invited to participate in the study if at least two siblings were 'long-lived', where 'long-lived' meant being older than 89 years for men or older than 91 years for women. As a result, more than 400 families were included in the study and followed for around 10 years. For estimation of marker-specific survival probabilities and correlations among life times of family members, delayed entry due to outcome-dependent sampling mechanisms has to be taken into account. We consider shared frailty models to model left-truncated correlated survival data. The treatment of left truncation in shared frailty models is still an open issue and the literature on this topic is scarce. We show that the current approaches provide, in general, biased estimates and we propose a new method to tackle this selection problem by applying a correction on the likelihood estimation by means of inverse probability weighting at the family level.

%X BACKGROUND: Cells can be primed by external stimuli to obtain a long-term epigenetic memory. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to elevated blood lipids can prime circulating immune cells through changes in DNA methylation, a process that may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. To interrogate the causal relationship between triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and genome-wide DNA methylation while excluding confounding and pleiotropy, we perform a stepwise Mendelian randomization analysis in whole blood of 3296 individuals. RESULTS: This analysis shows that differential methylation is the consequence of inter-individual variation in blood lipid levels and not vice versa. Specifically, we observe an effect of triglycerides on DNA methylation at three CpGs, of LDL cholesterol at one CpG, and of HDL cholesterol at two CpGs using multivariable Mendelian randomization. Using RNA-seq data available for a large subset of individuals (N = 2044), DNA methylation of these six CpGs is associated with the expression of CPT1A and SREBF1 (for triglycerides), DHCR24 (for LDL cholesterol) and ABCG1 (for HDL cholesterol), which are all key regulators of lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests a role for epigenetic priming in end-product feedback control of lipid metabolism and highlights Mendelian randomization as an effective tool to infer causal relationships in integrative genomics data.

%X Genetic studies have thus far identified a limited number of loci associated with human longevity by applying age at death or survival up to advanced ages as phenotype. As an alternative approach, one could first try to identify biomarkers of healthy ageing and the genetic variants associated with these traits and subsequently determine the association of these variants with human longevity. In the present study, we used this approach by testing whether the 35 baseline serum parameters measured in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) meet the proposed criteria for a biomarker of healthy ageing. The LLS consists of 421 families with long-lived siblings of European descent, who were recruited together with their offspring and the spouses of the offspring (controls). To test the four criteria for a biomarker of healthy ageing in the LLS, we determined the association of the serum parameters with chronological age, familial longevity, general practitioner-reported general health, and mortality. Out of the 35 serum parameters, we identified glucose, insulin, and triglycerides as biomarkers of healthy ageing, meeting all four criteria in the LLS. We subsequently showed that the genetic variants previously associated with these parameters are significantly enriched in the largest genome-wide association study for human longevity. In conclusion, we showed that biomarkers of healthy ageing can be used to leverage genetic studies into human longevity. We identified several genetic variants influencing the variation in glucose, insulin and triglycerides that contribute to human longevity.

%X Offspring of long-lived families are characterized by beneficial metabolic phenotypes in glucose and lipid metabolism and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Although the genetic basis for human longevity remains largely unclear, the contribution of variation at the APOE locus has been repeatedly demonstrated. We aimed to assess whether ApoE isoforms mark the familial longevity status in middle age and subsequently to test to what extend this association is mediated by the metabolic characteristics marking this status. From the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS), we included offspring from nonagenarian siblings and partners as controls. Using the metabolic phenotypes of familial longevity as mediators, we investigated how APOE gene variants associated with LLS offspring/control status (in 1,515 LLS offspring and 715 controls). Within the LLS (mean age = 59.2 years), ApoE epsilon4 was not associated with a lower likelihood of being an LLS offspring, whereas ApoE varepsilon2 was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of being an LLS offspring (odds ratio = 1.43), but this difference was not mediated (p-values>0.05) by any of the investigated metabolic phenotypes (e.g., diabetes and glucose). Therefore, variation at the APOE locus may not influence familial longevity status in middle age significantly through any of the metabolic mechanisms investigated.

%X The development of immune responses is influenced by the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Our previous study showed a close association between maternal and young infant's cytokine responses. The question is how this association evolves over time and the contribution of genetic polymorphisms to this association. Five cytokines in mitogen-stimulated whole blood culture were measured from pregnant mothers and their children aged 2, 5, 12, 24 and 48 months. Cytokine gene polymorphisms were determined in both mothers and children. High production of maternal interleukin (IL)-10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was significantly associated with higher levels of the corresponding cytokines in their children at 2 months (T2), but the association decreased over time. Maternal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IFN-gamma gene, rs3181032, was found to be associated with child's IFN-gamma levels at T2 only, whereas maternal IL-10 rs4579758 and child's TNF-alpha rs13215091 were associated with child's corresponding cytokines at later ages but not at T2. In the final models including the gene polymorphisms, maternal cytokines were still the strongest determinant of child cytokines. Maternal cytokine during pregnancy, which could be a proxy for child's environmental factors, showed its highest impact at early age, with no or little influence from genetic factors.

%X BACKGROUND: Epigenetic change is a hallmark of ageing but its link to ageing mechanisms in humans remains poorly understood. While DNA methylation at many CpG sites closely tracks chronological age, DNA methylation changes relevant to biological age are expected to gradually dissociate from chronological age, mirroring the increased heterogeneity in health status at older ages. RESULTS: Here, we report on the large-scale identification of 6366 age-related variably methylated positions (aVMPs) identified in 3295 whole blood DNA methylation profiles, 2044 of which have a matching RNA-seq gene expression profile. aVMPs are enriched at polycomb repressed regions and, accordingly, methylation at those positions is associated with the expression of genes encoding components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in trans. Further analysis revealed trans-associations for 1816 aVMPs with an additional 854 genes. These trans-associated aVMPs are characterized by either an age-related gain of methylation at CpG islands marked by PRC2 or a loss of methylation at enhancers. This distinct pattern extends to other tissues and multiple cancer types. Finally, genes associated with aVMPs in trans whose expression is variably upregulated with age (733 genes) play a key role in DNA repair and apoptosis, whereas downregulated aVMP-associated genes (121 genes) are mapped to defined pathways in cellular metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our results link age-related changes in DNA methylation to fundamental mechanisms that are thought to drive human ageing.

%X Genetic risk factors often localize to noncoding regions of the genome with unknown effects on disease etiology. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) help to explain the regulatory mechanisms underlying these genetic associations. Knowledge of the context that determines the nature and strength of eQTLs may help identify cell types relevant to pathophysiology and the regulatory networks underlying disease. Here we generated peripheral blood RNA-seq data from 2,116 unrelated individuals and systematically identified context-dependent eQTLs using a hypothesis-free strategy that does not require previous knowledge of the identity of the modifiers. Of the 23,060 significant cis-regulated genes (false discovery rate (FDR) </= 0.05), 2,743 (12%) showed context-dependent eQTL effects. The majority of these effects were influenced by cell type composition. A set of 145 cis-eQTLs depended on type I interferon signaling. Others were modulated by specific transcription factors binding to the eQTL SNPs.

%X Most disease-associated genetic variants are noncoding, making it challenging to design experiments to understand their functional consequences. Identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has been a powerful approach to infer the downstream effects of disease-associated variants, but most of these variants remain unexplained. The analysis of DNA methylation, a key component of the epigenome, offers highly complementary data on the regulatory potential of genomic regions. Here we show that disease-associated variants have widespread effects on DNA methylation in trans that likely reflect differential occupancy of trans binding sites by cis-regulated transcription factors. Using multiple omics data sets from 3,841 Dutch individuals, we identified 1,907 established trait-associated SNPs that affect the methylation levels of 10,141 different CpG sites in trans (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). These included SNPs that affect both the expression of a nearby transcription factor (such as NFKB1, CTCF and NKX2-3) and methylation of its respective binding site across the genome. Trans methylation QTLs effectively expose the downstream effects of disease-associated variants.

%X Multiple studies have shown that levels of (1)H-NMR metabolites are associated with disease and risk factors of disease such as BMI. While most previous investigations have been performed in fasting samples, meta-analysis often includes both cohorts with fasting and non-fasting blood samples. In the present study comprising 153 participants (mean age 63 years; mean BMI 27 kg/m(2)) we analyzed the effect of a standardized liquid meal (SLM) on metabolite levels and how the SLM influenced the association between metabolites and BMI. We observed that many metabolites, including glycolysis related metabolites, multiple amino acids, LDL diameter, VLDL and HDL lipid concentration changed within 35 minutes after a standardized liquid meal (SLM), similarly for all individuals. Remarkable, however, is that the correlations of metabolite levels with BMI remained highly similar before and after the SLM. Hence, as exemplified with the disease risk factor BMI, our results suggest that the applicability of (1)H-NMR metabolites as disease biomarkers depends on the standardization of the fasting status rather than on the fasting status itself. Future studies are required to investigate the dependency of metabolite biomarkers for other disease risk factors on the fasting status.

%X Emerging evidence suggests that the basis for variation in late-life mobility is attributable, in part, to genetic factors, which may become increasingly important with age. Our objective was to systematically assess the contribution of genetic variation to gait speed in older individuals. We conducted a meta-analysis of gait speed GWASs in 31,478 older adults from 17 cohorts of the CHARGE consortium, and validated our results in 2,588 older adults from 4 independent studies. We followed our initial discoveries with network and eQTL analysis of candidate signals in tissues. The meta-analysis resulted in a list of 536 suggestive genome wide significant SNPs in or near 69 genes. Further interrogation with Pathway Analysis placed gait speed as a polygenic complex trait in five major networks. Subsequent eQTL analysis revealed several SNPs significantly associated with the expression of PRSS16, WDSUB1 and PTPRT, which in addition to the meta-analysis and pathway suggested that genetic effects on gait speed may occur through synaptic function and neuronal development pathways. No genome-wide significant signals for gait speed were identified from this moderately large sample of older adults, suggesting that more refined physical function phenotypes will be needed to identify the genetic basis of gait speed in aging.

%X The association between telomere length (TL) dynamics on cognitive performance over the life-course is not well understood. This study meta-analyses observational and causal associations between TL and six cognitive traits, with stratifications on APOE genotype, in a Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework. Twelve European cohorts (N=17 052; mean age=59.2+/-8.8 years) provided results for associations between qPCR-measured TL (T/S-ratio scale) and general cognitive function, mini-mental state exam (MMSE), processing speed by digit symbol substitution test (DSST), visuospatial functioning, memory and executive functioning (STROOP). In addition, a genetic risk score (GRS) for TL including seven known genetic variants for TL was calculated, and used in associations with cognitive traits as outcomes in all cohorts. Observational analyses showed that longer telomeres were associated with better scores on DSST (beta=0.051 per s.d.-increase of TL; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.024, 0.077; P=0.0002), and MMSE (beta=0.025; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.047; P=0.03), and faster STROOP (beta=-0.053; 95% CI: -0.087, -0.018; P=0.003). Effects for DSST were stronger in APOE varepsilon4 non-carriers (beta=0.081; 95% CI: 0.045, 0.117; P=1.0 x 10(-5)), whereas carriers performed better in STROOP (beta=-0.074; 95% CI: -0.140, -0.009; P=0.03). Causal associations were found for STROOP only (beta=-0.598 per s.d.-increase of TL; 95% CI: -1.125, -0.072; P=0.026), with a larger effect in varepsilon4-carriers (beta=-0.699; 95% CI: -1.330, -0.069; P=0.03). Two-sample replication analyses using CHARGE summary statistics showed causal effects between TL and general cognitive function and DSST, but not with STROOP. In conclusion, we suggest causal effects from longer TL on better cognitive performance, where APOE varepsilon4-carriers might be at differential risk.

%X OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and the leading cause of disability in the elderly. Of all the joints, genetic predisposition is strongest for OA of the hand; however, only few genetic risk loci for hand OA have been identified. Our aim was to identify novel genes associated with hand OA and examine the underlying mechanism. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study of a quantitative measure of hand OA in 12 784 individuals (discovery: 8743, replication: 4011). Genome-wide significant signals were followed up by analysing gene and allele-specific expression in a RNA sequencing dataset (n=96) of human articular cartilage. RESULTS: We found two significantly associated loci in the discovery set: at chr12 (p=3.5 x 10(-10)) near the matrix Gla protein (MGP) gene and at chr12 (p=6.1x10(-9)) near the CCDC91 gene. The DNA variant near the MGP gene was validated in three additional studies, which resulted in a highly significant association between the MGP variant and hand OA (rs4764133, Betameta=0.83, Pmeta=1.8*10(-15)). This variant is high linkage disequilibrium with a coding variant in MGP, a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of cartilage calcification. Using RNA sequencing data from human primary cartilage tissue (n=96), we observed that the MGP RNA expression of the hand OA risk allele was significantly lowercompared with the MGP RNA expression of the reference allele (40.7%, p<5*10(-16)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the association between the MGP variant and increased risk for hand OA is caused by a lower expression of MGP, which may increase the burden of hand OA by decreased inhibition of cartilage calcification.

%X AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Circulating metabolites have been shown to reflect metabolic changes during the development of type 2 diabetes. In this study we examined the association of metabolite levels and pairwise metabolite ratios with insulin responses after glucose, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and arginine stimulation. We then investigated if the identified metabolite ratios were associated with measures of OGTT-derived beta cell function and with prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We measured the levels of 188 metabolites in plasma samples from 130 healthy members of twin families (from the Netherlands Twin Register) at five time points during a modified 3 h hyperglycaemic clamp with glucose, GLP-1 and arginine stimulation. We validated our results in cohorts with OGTT data (n = 340) and epidemiological case-control studies of prevalent (n = 4925) and incident (n = 4277) diabetes. The data were analysed using regression models with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: There were dynamic changes in metabolite levels in response to the different secretagogues. Furthermore, several fasting pairwise metabolite ratios were associated with one or multiple clamp-derived measures of insulin secretion (all p < 9.2 x 10(-7)). These associations were significantly stronger compared with the individual metabolite components. One of the ratios, valine to phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C32:2 (PC ae C32:2), in addition showed a directionally consistent positive association with OGTT-derived measures of insulin secretion and resistance (p </= 5.4 x 10(-3)) and prevalent type 2 diabetes (ORVal_PC ae C32:2 2.64 [beta 0.97 +/- 0.09], p = 1.0 x 10(-27)). Furthermore, Val_PC ae C32:2 predicted incident diabetes independent of established risk factors in two epidemiological cohort studies (HRVal_PC ae C32:2 1.57 [beta 0.45 +/- 0.06]; p = 1.3 x 10(-15)), leading to modest improvements in the receiver operating characteristics when added to a model containing a set of established risk factors in both cohorts (increases from 0.780 to 0.801 and from 0.862 to 0.865 respectively, when added to the model containing traditional risk factors + glucose). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this study we have shown that the Val_PC ae C32:2 metabolite ratio is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and measures of insulin secretion and resistance. The observed effects were stronger than that of the individual metabolites and independent of known risk factors.

%X BACKGROUND: Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translation modifications with large influences on protein structure and function. The effector function of immunoglobulin G (IgG) alters between pro- and anti-inflammatory, based on its glycosylation. IgG glycan synthesis is highly complex and dynamic. METHODS: With the use of two different analytical methods for assessing IgG glycosylation, we aim to elucidate the link between DNA methylation and glycosylation of IgG by means of epigenome-wide association studies. In total, 3000 individuals from 4 cohorts were analyzed. RESULTS: The overlap of the results from the two glycan measurement panels yielded DNA methylation of 7 CpG-sites on 5 genomic locations to be associated with IgG glycosylation: cg25189904 (chr.1, GNG12); cg05951221, cg21566642 and cg01940273 (chr.2, ALPPL2); cg05575921 (chr.5, AHRR); cg06126421 (6p21.33); and cg03636183 (chr.19, F2RL3). Mediation analyses with respect to smoking revealed that the effect of smoking on IgG glycosylation may be at least partially mediated via DNA methylation levels at these 7 CpG-sites. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the presence of an indirect link between DNA methylation and IgG glycosylation that may in part capture environmental exposures. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: An epigenome-wide analysis conducted in four population-based cohorts revealed an association between DNA methylation and IgG glycosylation patterns. Presumably, DNA methylation mediates the effect of smoking on IgG glycosylation.

%X In the field of aging research, family-based sampling study designs are commonly used to study the lifespans of long-lived family members. However, the specific sampling procedure should be carefully taken into account in order to avoid biases. This work is motivated by the Leiden Longevity Study, a family-based cohort of long-lived siblings. Families were invited to participate in the study if at least two siblings were 'long-lived', where 'long-lived' meant being older than 89 years for men or older than 91 years for women. As a result, more than 400 families were included in the study and followed for around 10 years. For estimation of marker-specific survival probabilities and correlations among life times of family members, delayed entry due to outcome-dependent sampling mechanisms has to be taken into account. We consider shared frailty models to model left-truncated correlated survival data. The treatment of left truncation in shared frailty models is still an open issue and the literature on this topic is scarce. We show that the current approaches provide, in general, biased estimates and we propose a new method to tackle this selection problem by applying a correction on the likelihood estimation by means of inverse probability weighting at the family level.

%X Vitamin D is a steroid hormone precursor that is associated with a range of human traits and diseases. Previous GWAS of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations have identified four genome-wide significant loci (GC, NADSYN1/DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP24A1). In this study, we expand the previous SUNLIGHT Consortium GWAS discovery sample size from 16,125 to 79,366 (all European descent). This larger GWAS yields two additional loci harboring genome-wide significant variants (P = 4.7x10(-9) at rs8018720 in SEC23A, and P = 1.9x10(-14) at rs10745742 in AMDHD1). The overall estimate of heritability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations attributable to GWAS common SNPs is 7.5%, with statistically significant loci explaining 38% of this total. Further investigation identifies signal enrichment in immune and hematopoietic tissues, and clustering with autoimmune diseases in cell-type-specific analysis. Larger studies are required to identify additional common SNPs, and to explore the role of rare or structural variants and gene-gene interactions in the heritability of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.

%X Immunoglobulin G (IgG), a glycoprotein secreted by plasma B-cells, plays a major role in the human adaptive immune response and are associated with a wide range of diseases. Glycosylation of the Fc binding region of IgGs, responsible for the antibody's effector function, is essential for prompting a proper immune response. This study focuses on the general genetic impact on IgG glycosylation as well as corresponding subclass specificities. To identify genetic loci involved in IgG glycosylation, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS)-measured IgG glycopeptides of 1,823 individuals in the Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region (KORA F4) study cohort. In addition, we performed GWAS on subclass-specific ratios of IgG glycans to gain power in identifying genetic factors underlying single enzymatic steps in the glycosylation pathways. We replicated our findings in 1,836 individuals from the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS). We were able to show subclass-specific genetic influences on single IgG glycan structures. The replicated results indicate that, in addition to genes encoding for glycosyltransferases (i.e., ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8, and MGAT3), other genetic loci have strong influences on the IgG glycosylation patterns. A novel locus on chromosome 1, harboring RUNX3, which encodes for a transcription factor of the runt domain-containing family, is associated with decreased galactosylation. Interestingly, members of the RUNX family are cross-regulated, and RUNX3 is involved in both IgA class switching and B-cell maturation as well as T-cell differentiation and apoptosis. Besides the involvement of glycosyltransferases in IgG glycosylation, we suggest that, due to the impact of variants within RUNX3, potentially mechanisms involved in B-cell activation and T-cell differentiation during the immune response as well as cell migration and invasion involve IgG glycosylation.

%X IMPORTANCE: Sex differences in genetic associations with human longevity remain largely unknown; investigations on this topic are important for individualized health care. OBJECTIVE: To explore sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based case-control study used sex-specific genome-wide association study and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to examine sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. Five hundred sixty-four male and 1614 female participants older than 100 years were compared with a control group of 773 male and 1526 female individuals aged 40 to 64 years. All were Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study participants with Han ethnicity who were recruited in 1998 and 2008 to 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sex-specific loci and pathways associated with longevity and PRS measures of joint effects of sex-specific loci. RESULTS: Eleven male-specific and 11 female-specific longevity loci (P < 10(-5)) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific longevity loci (10(-5) </= P < 10(-4)) were identified. Each of these loci's associations with longevity were replicated in north and south regions of China in one sex but were not significant in the other sex (P = .13-.97), and loci-sex interaction effects were significant (P < .05). The associations of loci rs60210535 of the LINC00871 gene with longevity were replicated in Chinese women (P = 9.0 x 10(-5)) and US women (P = 4.6 x 10(-5)) but not significant in Chinese and US men. The associations of the loci rs2622624 of the ABCG2 gene were replicated in Chinese women (P = 6.8 x 10(-5)) and European women (P = .003) but not significant in both Chinese and European men. Eleven male-specific pathways (inflammation and immunity genes) and 34 female-specific pathways (tryptophan metabolism and PGC-1alpha induced) were significantly associated with longevity (P < .005; false discovery rate < 0.05). The PRS analyses demonstrated that sex-specific associations with longevity of the 4 exclusive groups of 11 male-specific and 11 female-specific loci (P < 10(-5)) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific loci (10(-5) </=P < 10(-4)) were jointly replicated across north and south discovery and target samples. Analyses using the combined data set of north and south showed that these 4 groups of sex-specific loci were jointly and significantly associated with longevity in one sex (P = 2.9 x 10(-70) to 1.3 x 10(-39)) but not jointly significant in the other sex (P = .11 to .70), while interaction effects between PRS and sex were significant (P = 4.8 x 10(-50) to 1.2 x 10(-16)). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The sex differences in genetic associations with longevity are remarkable, but have been overlooked by previously published genome-wide association studies on longevity. This study contributes to filling this research gap and provides a scientific basis for further investigating effects of sex-specific genetic variants and their interactions with environment on healthy aging, which may substantially contribute to more effective and targeted individualized health care for male and female elderly individuals.

%X Thyroid dysfunction is an important public health problem, which affects 10% of the general population and increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of thyroid hormone regulation have only partly been elucidated, including its transport, metabolism, and genetic determinants. Here we report a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for thyroid function and dysfunction, testing 8 million genetic variants in up to 72,167 individuals. One-hundred-and-nine independent genetic variants are associated with these traits. A genetic risk score, calculated to assess their combined effects on clinical end points, shows significant associations with increased risk of both overt (Graves' disease) and subclinical thyroid disease, as well as clinical complications. By functional follow-up on selected signals, we identify a novel thyroid hormone transporter (SLC17A4) and a metabolizing enzyme (AADAT). Together, these results provide new knowledge about thyroid hormone physiology and disease, opening new possibilities for therapeutic targets.

%X C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive biomarker of chronic low-grade inflammation and is associated with multiple complex diseases. The genetic determinants of chronic inflammation remain largely unknown, and the causal role of CRP in several clinical outcomes is debated. We performed two genome-wide association studies (GWASs), on HapMap and 1000 Genomes imputed data, of circulating amounts of CRP by using data from 88 studies comprising 204,402 European individuals. Additionally, we performed in silico functional analyses and Mendelian randomization analyses with several clinical outcomes. The GWAS meta-analyses of CRP revealed 58 distinct genetic loci (p < 5 x 10(-8)). After adjustment for body mass index in the regression analysis, the associations at all except three loci remained. The lead variants at the distinct loci explained up to 7.0% of the variance in circulating amounts of CRP. We identified 66 gene sets that were organized in two substantially correlated clusters, one mainly composed of immune pathways and the other characterized by metabolic pathways in the liver. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed a causal protective effect of CRP on schizophrenia and a risk-increasing effect on bipolar disorder. Our findings provide further insights into the biology of inflammation and could lead to interventions for treating inflammation and its clinical consequences.

%X Telomere shortening has been associated with multiple age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dementia. However, the biological mechanisms responsible for these associations remain largely unknown. In order to gain insight into the metabolic processes driving the association of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) with age-related diseases, we investigated the association between LTL and serum metabolite levels in 7,853 individuals from seven independent cohorts. LTL was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the levels of 131 serum metabolites were measured with mass spectrometry in biological samples from the same blood draw. With partial correlation analysis, we identified six metabolites that were significantly associated with LTL after adjustment for multiple testing: lysophosphatidylcholine acyl C17:0 (lysoPC a C17:0, p-value = 7.1 x 10(-6)), methionine (p-value = 9.2 x 10(-5)), tyrosine (p-value = 2.1 x 10(-4)), phosphatidylcholine diacyl C32:1 (PC aa C32:1, p-value = 2.4 x 10(-4)), hydroxypropionylcarnitine (C3-OH, p-value = 2.6 x 10(-4)), and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C38:4 (PC ae C38:4, p-value = 9.0 x 10(-4)). Pathway analysis showed that the three phosphatidylcholines and methionine are involved in homocysteine metabolism and we found supporting evidence for an association of lipid metabolism with LTL. In conclusion, we found longer LTL associated with higher levels of lysoPC a C17:0 and PC ae C38:4, and with lower levels of methionine, tyrosine, PC aa C32:1, and C3-OH. These metabolites have been implicated in inflammation, oxidative stress, homocysteine metabolism, and in cardiovascular disease and diabetes, two major drivers of morbidity and mortality.

%X Human longevity is heritable, but genome-wide association (GWA) studies have had limited success. Here, we perform two meta-analyses of GWA studies of a rigorous longevity phenotype definition including 11,262/3484 cases surviving at or beyond the age corresponding to the 90th/99th survival percentile, respectively, and 25,483 controls whose age at death or at last contact was at or below the age corresponding to the 60th survival percentile. Consistent with previous reports, rs429358 (apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4) is associated with lower odds of surviving to the 90th and 99th percentile age, while rs7412 (ApoE epsilon2) shows the opposite. Moreover, rs7676745, located near GPR78, associates with lower odds of surviving to the 90th percentile age. Gene-level association analysis reveals a role for tissue-specific expression of multiple genes in longevity. Finally, genetic correlation of the longevity GWA results with that of several disease-related phenotypes points to a shared genetic architecture between health and longevity.

%X Predicting longer-term mortality risk requires collection of clinical data, which is often cumbersome. Therefore, we use a well-standardized metabolomics platform to identify metabolic predictors of long-term mortality in the circulation of 44,168 individuals (age at baseline 18-109), of whom 5512 died during follow-up. We apply a stepwise (forward-backward) procedure based on meta-analysis results and identify 14 circulating biomarkers independently associating with all-cause mortality. Overall, these associations are similar in men and women and across different age strata. We subsequently show that the prediction accuracy of 5- and 10-year mortality based on a model containing the identified biomarkers and sex (C-statistic = 0.837 and 0.830, respectively) is better than that of a model containing conventional risk factors for mortality (C-statistic = 0.772 and 0.790, respectively). The use of the identified metabolic profile as a predictor of mortality or surrogate endpoint in clinical studies needs further investigation.

%X SCOPE: Abdominal obesity is one of the main modifiable risk factors of age-related cardiometabolic disease. Cardiometabolic disease risk and its associated high abdominal fat mass, cholesterol, and glucose concentrations can be reduced by a healthier lifestyle. Hence, the aim is to understand the relation between lifestyle-induced changes in body composition, and specifically abdominal fat, and accompanying changes in circulating metabolic biomarkers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from the Growing Old Together (GOTO) study was used, which is a single arm lifestyle intervention in which 164 older adults (mean age 63 years, BMI 23-35 kg/m(2) ) changed their lifestyle during 13 weeks by 12.5% caloric restriction plus 12.5% increase in energy expenditure. It is shown here that levels of circulating metabolic biomarkers, even after adjustment for body mass index, specifically associate with abdominal fat mass. The applied lifestyle intervention mainly reduces abdominal fat mass (-2.6%, SD = 3.0) and this reduction, when adjusted for general weight loss, is highly associated with decreased circulating glycerol concentrations and increased HDL diameter. CONCLUSION: The lifestyle-induced reduction of abdominal fat mass is particularly associated, independent of body mass index or general weight loss, with decreased circulating glycerol concentrations and increased HDL diameter.

%X BACKGROUND: Dietary restriction (DR), a reduction in food intake without malnutrition, increases most aspects of health during aging and extends lifespan in diverse species, including rodents. However, the mechanisms by which DR interacts with the aging process to improve health in old age are poorly understood. DNA methylation could play an important role in mediating the effects of DR because it is sensitive to the effects of nutrition and can affect gene expression memory over time. RESULTS: Here, we profile genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, gene expression and lipidomics in response to DR and aging in female mouse liver. DR is generally strongly protective against age-related changes in DNA methylation. During aging with DR, DNA methylation becomes targeted to gene bodies and is associated with reduced gene expression, particularly of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The lipid profile of the livers of DR mice is correspondingly shifted towards lowered triglyceride content and shorter chain length of triglyceride-associated fatty acids, and these effects become more pronounced with age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that DR remodels genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation so that age-related changes are profoundly delayed, while changes at loci involved in lipid metabolism affect gene expression and the resulting lipid profile.

%X Ageing generates senescent pathologies, some of which cause death. Interventions that delay or prevent lethal pathologies will extend lifespan. Here we identify life-limiting pathologies in Caenorhabditis elegans with a necropsy analysis of worms that have died of old age. Our results imply the presence of multiple causes of death. Specifically, we identify two classes of corpse: early deaths with a swollen pharynx (which we call 'P deaths'), and later deaths with an atrophied pharynx (termed 'p deaths'). The effects of interventions on lifespan can be broken down into changes in the frequency and/or timing of either form of death. For example, glp-1 mutation only delays p death, while eat-2 mutation reduces P death. Combining pathology and mortality analysis allows mortality profiles to be deconvolved, providing biological meaning to complex survival and mortality profiles.

%X Ageing is a progressive decline of intrinsic physiological functions. We examined the impact of ageing on the ultrastructure and function of mitochondria in mouse and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) by electron cryo-tomography and respirometry and discovered distinct age-related changes in both model organisms. Mitochondrial function and ultrastructure are maintained in mouse heart, whereas subpopulations of mitochondria from mouse liver show age-related changes in membrane morphology. Subpopulations of mitochondria from young and old mouse kidney resemble those described for apoptosis. In aged flies, respiratory activity is compromised and the production of peroxide radicals is increased. In about 50% of mitochondria from old flies, the inner membrane organization breaks down. This establishes a clear link between inner membrane architecture and functional decline. Mitochondria were affected by ageing to very different extents, depending on the organism and possibly on the degree to which tissues within the same organism are protected against mitochondrial damage.

%X Myoglianin, the Drosophila homolog of the secreted vertebrate proteins Myostatin and GDF-11, is an important regulator of neuronal modelling, and synapse function and morphology. While Myoglianin suppression during development elicits positive effects on the neuromuscular system, genetic manipulations of myoglianin expression levels have a varied effect on the outcome of performance tests in aging flies. Specifically, Myoglianin preserves jumping ability, has no effect on negative geotaxis, and negatively regulates flight performance in aging flies. In addition, Myoglianin exhibits a tissue-specific effect on longevity, with myoglianin upregulation in glial cells increasing the median lifespan. These findings indicate complex role for this TGF-beta-like protein in governing neuromuscular signalling and consequent behavioural outputs and lifespan in adult flies.

%X Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is highly soluble and natively unfolded. Its dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it aggregates within neurons. Deciphering the physiological and pathogenic roles of human Tau (hTau) is crucial to further understand the mechanisms leading to its dysfunction in vivo. We have used a knock-out/knock-in strategy in Drosophila to generate a strain with hTau inserted into the endogenous fly tau locus and expressed under the control of the endogenous fly tau promoter, thus avoiding potential toxicity due to genetic over-expression. hTau knock-in (KI) proteins were expressed at normal, endogenous levels, bound to fly microtubules and were post-translationally modified, hence displaying physiological properties. We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo. The simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of hTau at lysines 163, 280, 281 and 369 drastically decreased hTau phosphorylation and significantly reduced its binding to microtubules in vivo. These molecular alterations were associated with ameliorated amyloid beta toxicity. Our results indicate acetylation of hTau on multiple sites regulates its biology and ameliorates amyloid beta toxicity in vivo.

%X Lowered activity of the insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) network can ameliorate the effects of ageing in laboratory animals and, possibly, humans. Although transcriptome remodelling in long-lived IIS mutants has been extensively documented, the causal mechanisms contributing to extended lifespan, particularly in specific tissues, remain unclear. We have characterized the proteomes of four key insulin-sensitive tissues in a long-lived Drosophila IIS mutant and control, and detected 44% of the predicted proteome (6,085 proteins). Expression of ribosome-associated proteins in the fat body was reduced in the mutant, with a corresponding, tissue-specific reduction in translation. Expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins in fat body was increased, leading to increased respiration, which was necessary for IIS-mediated lifespan extension, and alone sufficient to mediate it. Proteasomal subunits showed altered expression in IIS mutant gut, and gut-specific over-expression of the RPN6 proteasomal subunit, was sufficient to increase proteasomal activity and extend lifespan, whilst inhibition of proteasome activity abolished IIS-mediated longevity. Our study thus uncovered strikingly tissue-specific responses of cellular processes to lowered IIS acting in concert to ameliorate ageing.

%X Reduced activity of nutrient-sensing signaling networks can extend organismal lifespan, yet the underlying biology remains unclear. We show that the anti-aging effects of rapamycin and reduced intestinal insulin/insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS) require the Drosophila FoxA transcription factor homolog Fork Head (FKH). Intestinal FKH induction extends lifespan, highlighting a role for the gut. FKH binds to and is phosphorylated by AKT and Target of Rapamycin. Gut-specific FKH upregulation improves gut barrier function in aged flies. Additionally, it increases the expression of nutrient transporters, as does lowered IIS. Evolutionary conservation of this effect of lowered IIS is suggested by the upregulation of related nutrient transporters in insulin receptor substrate 1 knockout mouse intestine. Our study highlights a critical role played by FKH in the gut in mediating anti-aging effects of reduced IIS. Malnutrition caused by poor intestinal absorption is a major problem in the elderly, and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved will have important therapeutic implications for human aging.

%X Organismal physiology and survival are influenced by environmental conditions and linked to protein quality control. Proteome integrity is achieved by maintaining an intricate balance between protein folding and degradation. In Caenorhabditis elegans, acute heat stress determines cell non-autonomous regulation of chaperone levels. However, how the perception of environmental changes, including physiological temperature, affects protein degradation remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that loss-of-function of dyf-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans associated with dysfunctional sensory neurons leads to defects in both temperature perception and thermal adaptation of the ubiquitin/proteasome system centered on thermosensory AFD neurons. Impaired perception of moderate temperature changes worsens ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in intestinal cells. Brain-gut communication regulating protein turnover is mediated by upregulation of the insulin-like peptide INS-5 and inhibition of the calcineurin-regulated forkhead-box transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Our data indicate that perception of ambient temperature and its neuronal integration is important for the control of proteome integrity in complex organisms.

To suppress the deleterious toxicity of SidE enzymes in a timely manner, LP employs a metaeffector named SidJ. Upon activation by host Calmodulin (CaM), SidJ executes an ATP-dependent glutamylation to modify the catalytic residue Glu860 in the mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (mART) domain of SdeA. SidJ is a unique glutamylase that adopts a kinase-like fold but contains two nucleotide-binding pockets. There is a lack of consensus about the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of SidJ. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of SidJ in complex with its substrate SdeA in two different states of catalysis. Our structures reveal that both phosphodiesterase (PDE) and mART domains of SdeA make extensive contacts with SidJ. In the pre-glutamylation state structure of the SidJ-SdeA complex, adenylylated E860 of SdeA is inserted into the non-canonical (migrated) nucleotide-binding pocket of SidJ. Structure-based mutational analysis indicates that SidJ employs its migrated pocket for the glutamylation of SdeA. Finally, using mass spectrometry, we identified several transient autoAMPylation sites close to both the catalytic pockets of SidJ. Our data provide unique insights into the substrate recognition and the mechanism of protein glutamylation by the pseudokinase SidJ.

%X SidE family of Legionella effectors catalyze non-canonical phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination (PR-ubiquitination) of host proteins during bacterial infection. SdeA localizes predominantly to ER and partially to the Golgi apparatus, and mediates serine ubiquitination of multiple ER and Golgi proteins. Here we show that SdeA causes disruption of Golgi integrity due to its ubiquitin ligase activity. The Golgi linking proteins GRASP55 and GRASP65 are PR-ubiquitinated on multiple serine residues, thus preventing their ability to cluster and form oligomeric structures. In addition, we found that the functional consequence of Golgi disruption is not linked to the recruitment of Golgi membranes to the growing Legionella-containing vacuoles. Instead, it affects the host secretory pathway. Taken together, our study sheds light on the Golgi manipulation strategy by which Legionella hijacks the secretory pathway and promotes bacterial infection.

%X ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins that controls many cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, chromatin regulation and mitosis. A number of proteins catalyse the transfer and hydrolysis of ADPr, and also specify how and when the modification is conjugated to the targets. We recently discovered a new form of ADPr that is attached to serine residues in target proteins (Ser-ADPr) and showed that this PTM is specifically made by PARP1/HPF1 and PARP2/HPF1 complexes. In this work, we found by quantitative proteomics that histone Ser-ADPr is reversible in cells during response to DNA damage. By screening for the hydrolase that is responsible for the reversal of Ser-ADPr, we identified ARH3/ADPRHL2 as capable of efficiently and specifically removing Ser-ADPr of histones and other proteins. We further showed that Ser-ADPr is a major PTM in cells after DNA damage and that this signalling is dependent on ARH3.

%X Protein ADP-ribosylation (ADPr), a biologically and clinically important post-translational modification, exerts its functions by targeting a variety of different amino acids. Its repertoire recently expanded to include serine ADPr, which is emerging as an important and widespread signal in the DNA damage response. Chemically, serine ADPr (and more generally o-glycosidic ADPr) is a form of o-glycosylation, and its extreme lability renders it practically invisible to standard mass spectrometry approaches, often leading to erroneous localizations. The knowledge from the mature field of o-glycosation and our own initial difficulties with mass spectrometric analyzes of serine ADPr suggest how to avoid these misidentifications and fully explore the scope of o-glycosidic ADPr in DNA damage response and beyond.

%X MaxQuant is a quantitative proteomics software package designed for analyzing large mass spectrometric data sets. It is specifically aimed at high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) data. Currently, Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap and LTQ-FT-ICR instruments are supported and Mascot is used as a search engine. This protocol explains step by step how to use MaxQuant on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) data obtained with double or triple labeling. Complex experimental designs, such as time series and drug-response data, are supported. A standard desktop computer is sufficient to fulfill the computational requirements. The workflow has been stress tested with more than 1,000 liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry runs in a single project. In a typical SILAC proteome experiment, hundreds of thousands of peptides and thousands of proteins are automatically and reliably quantified. Additional information for identified proteins, such as Gene Ontology, domain composition and pathway membership, is provided in the output tables ready for further bioinformatics analysis. The software is freely available at the MaxQuant home page.

%X The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a growth-related kinase that, in the context of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), touches upon most fundamental cellular processes. Consequently, its activity is a critical determinant for cellular and organismal physiology, while its dysregulation is commonly linked to human aging and age-related disease. Presumably the most important stimulus that regulates mTORC1 activity is nutrient sufficiency, whereby amino acids play a predominant role. In fact, mTORC1 functions as a molecular sensor for amino acids, linking the cellular demand to the nutritional supply. Notably, dietary restriction (DR), a nutritional regimen that has been shown to extend lifespan and improve healthspan in a broad spectrum of organisms, works via limiting nutrient uptake and changes in mTORC1 activity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1, using rapamycin or its analogs (rapalogs), can mimic the pro-longevity effects of DR. Conversely, nutritional amino acid overload has been tightly linked to aging and diseases, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Similar effects can also be recapitulated by mutations in upstream mTORC1 regulators, thus establishing a tight connection between mTORC1 signaling and aging. Although the role of growth factor signaling upstream of mTORC1 in aging has been investigated extensively, the involvement of signaling components participating in the nutrient sensing branch is less well understood. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that signal nutrient availability to mTORC1, and summarize the role that nutrients, nutrient sensors, and other components of the nutrient sensing machinery play in cellular and organismal aging.

%X Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and G3BP2, respectively) are widely recognized as core components of stress granules (SGs). We report that G3BPs reside at the cytoplasmic surface of lysosomes. They act in a non-redundant manner to anchor the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex to lysosomes and suppress activation of the metabolic master regulator mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids and insulin. Like the TSC complex, G3BP1 deficiency elicits phenotypes related to mTORC1 hyperactivity. In the context of tumors, low G3BP1 levels enhance mTORC1-driven breast cancer cell motility and correlate with adverse outcomes in patients. Furthermore, G3bp1 inhibition in zebrafish disturbs neuronal development and function, leading to white matter heterotopia and neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, G3BPs are not only core components of SGs but also a key element of lysosomal TSC-mTORC1 signaling.

%X Cells communicate with their environment via surface proteins and secreted factors. Unconventional protein secretion (UPS) is an evolutionarily conserved process, via which distinct cargo proteins are secreted upon stress. Most UPS types depend upon the Golgi-associated GRASP55 protein. However, its regulation and biological role remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) directly phosphorylates GRASP55 to maintain its Golgi localization, thus revealing a physiological role for mTORC1 at this organelle. Stimuli that inhibit mTORC1 cause GRASP55 dephosphorylation and relocalization to UPS compartments. Through multiple, unbiased, proteomic analyses, we identify numerous cargoes that follow this unconventional secretory route to reshape the cellular secretome and surfactome. Using MMP2 secretion as a proxy for UPS, we provide important insights on its regulation and physiological role. Collectively, our findings reveal the mTORC1-GRASP55 signaling hub as the integration point in stress signaling upstream of UPS and as a key coordinator of the cellular adaptation to stress.

%X The TSC complex is a critical negative regulator of the small GTPase Rheb and mTORC1 in cellular stress signaling. The TSC2 subunit contains a catalytic GTPase activating protein domain and interacts with multiple regulators, while the precise function of TSC1 is unknown. Here we provide a structural characterization of TSC1 and define three domains: a C-terminal coiled-coil that interacts with TSC2, a central helical domain that mediates TSC1 oligomerization, and an N-terminal HEAT repeat domain that interacts with membrane phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). TSC1 architecture, oligomerization, and membrane binding are conserved in fungi and humans. We show that lysosomal recruitment of the TSC complex and subsequent inactivation of mTORC1 upon starvation depend on the marker lipid PI3,5P2, demonstrating a role for lysosomal PIPs in regulating TSC complex and mTORC1 activity via TSC1. Our study thus identifies a vital role of TSC1 in TSC complex function and mTORC1 signaling.

%X Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is essential for the maintenance, expression, and packaging of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Recently, a pathogenic homozygous variant in TFAM (P178L) has been associated with a severe mtDNA depletion syndrome leading to neonatal liver failure and early death. We have performed a biochemical characterization of the TFAM variant P178L in order to understand the molecular basis for the pathogenicity of this mutation. We observe no effects on DNA binding, and compaction of DNA is only mildly affected by the P178L amino acid change. Instead, the mutation severely impairs mtDNA transcription initiation at the mitochondrial heavy and light strand promoters. Molecular modeling suggests that the P178L mutation affects promoter sequence recognition and the interaction between TFAM and the tether helix of POLRMT, thus explaining transcription initiation deficiency.

%X Protein homeostasis is modulated by stress response pathways and its deficiency is a hallmark of aging. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved stress-signaling pathway that tunes mRNA translation via phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2. ISR activation and translation initiation are finely balanced by eIF2 kinases and by the eIF2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. However, the role of the ISR during aging remains poorly understood. Using a genomic mutagenesis screen for longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans, we define a role of eIF2 modulation in aging. By inhibiting the ISR, dominant mutations in eIF2B enhance protein homeostasis and increase lifespan. Consistently, full ISR inhibition using phosphorylation-defective eIF2alpha or pharmacological ISR inhibition prolong lifespan. Lifespan extension through impeding the ISR occurs without a reduction in overall protein synthesis. Instead, we observe changes in the translational efficiency of a subset of mRNAs, of which the putative kinase kin-35 is required for lifespan extension. Evidently, lifespan is limited by the ISR and its inhibition may provide an intervention in aging.

%X Cardiomyopathy and heart failure are common manifestations in mitochondrial disease caused by deficiencies in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system of mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that the cardiac-specific loss of the assembly factor Cox10 of the cytochrome c oxidase causes mitochondrial cardiomyopathy in mice, which is associated with OXPHOS deficiency, lysosomal defects, and an aberrant mitochondrial morphology. Activation of the mitochondrial peptidase Oma1 in Cox10(-/-) mice results in mitochondrial fragmentation and induction of the integrated stress response (ISR) along the Oma1-Dele1-Atf4 signaling axis. Ablation of Oma1 or Dele1 in Cox10(-/-) mice aggravates cardiomyopathy. ISR inhibition impairs the cardiac glutathione metabolism, limits the selenium-dependent accumulation of the glutathione peroxidase Gpx4, and increases lipid peroxidation in the heart, ultimately culminating in ferroptosis. Our results demonstrate a protective role of the Oma1-Dele1-mediated ISR in mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and link ferroptosis to OXPHOS deficiency and mitochondrial disease.

%X BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of timing as opposed to frequency and intensity of daily physical activity on metabolic health. Therefore, we assessed the association between accelerometery-based daily timing of physical activity and measures of metabolic health in sedentary older people. METHODS: Hourly mean physical activity derived from wrist-worn accelerometers over a 6-day period was collected at baseline and after 3 months in sedentary participants from the Active and Healthy Ageing study. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the number of dimensions (e.g. define periods instead of separate hours) of hourly physical activity at baseline and change during follow-up. Cross-sectionally, a multivariable-adjusted linear regression analysis was used to associate the principal components, particularly correlated with increased physical activity in data-driven periods during the day, with body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose and insulin, HbA1c and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). For the longitudinal analyses, we calculated the hourly changes in physical activity and change in metabolic health after follow-up. RESULTS: We included 207 individuals (61.4% male, mean age: 64.8 [SD 2.9], mean BMI: 28.9 [4.7]). Higher physical activity in the early morning was associated with lower fasting glucose (-2.22%, 95% CI: -4.19, -0.40), fasting insulin (-13.54%, 95%CI: -23.49, -4.39), and HOMA-IR (-16.07%, 95%CI: -27.63, -5.65). Higher physical activity in the late afternoon to evening was associated with lower BMI (-2.84%, 95% CI: -4.92, -0.70). Higher physical activity at night was associated with higher BMI (2.86%, 95% CI: 0.90, 4.78), fasting glucose (2.57%, 95% CI: 0.70, 4.30), and HbA1c (2.37%, 95% CI: 1.00, 3.82). Similar results were present in the prospective analysis. CONCLUSION: Specific physical activity timing patterns were associated with more beneficial metabolic health, suggesting particular time-dependent physical activity interventions might maximise health benefits.

%X Glucosamine feeding and genetic activation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) have been linked to improved protein quality control and lifespan extension. However, as an energy sensor, the HBP has been implicated in tumor progression and diabetes. Given these opposing outcomes, it is imperative to explore the long-term effects of chronic HBP activation in mammals. Thus, we asked if HBP activation affects metabolism, coordination, memory, and survival in mice. N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) supplementation in the drinking water had no adverse effect on weight in males but increased weight in young females. Glucose or insulin tolerance was not affected up to 20 months of age. Of note, we observed improved memory in young male mice supplemented with GlcNAc. Survival was not changed by GlcNAc treatment. To assess the effects of genetic HBP activation, we overexpressed the pathway's key enzyme GFAT1 and a constitutively activated mutant form in all mouse tissues. We detected elevated levels of the HBP product UDP-GlcNAc in mouse brains, but did not find any effects on behavior, memory, or survival. Together, while dietary GlcNAc supplementation did not extend survival in mice, it positively affected memory and is generally well tolerated.

%X Many of the leading causes of death in humans, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease are influenced by biological mechanisms that become dysregulated with increasing age. Hence, by targeting these ageing-related mechanisms, we may be able to improve health in old age. Ageing is partly heritable and genetic studies have been moderately successful in identifying genetic variants associated with ageing-related phenotypes (lifespan, healthspan and longevity). To decipher the mechanisms by which the identified variants influence ageing, studies that focus on their functional validation are vital. In this perspective, we describe the steps that could be taken in the process of functional validation: (1) in silico characterisation using bioinformatic tools; (2) in vitro characterisation using cell lines or organoids; and (3) in vivo characterisation studies using model organisms. For the in vivo characterisation, it is important to focus on translational phenotypes that are indicative of both healthspan and lifespan, such as the frailty index, to inform subsequent intervention studies. The depth of functional validation of a genetic variant depends on its location in the genome and conservation in model organisms. Moreover, some variants may prove to be hard to characterise due to context-dependent effects related to the experimental environment or genetic background. Future efforts to functionally characterise the (newly) identified genetic variants should shed light on the mechanisms underlying ageing and will help in the design of targeted interventions to improve health in old age.

%X Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable and lethal neurodegenerative disease in which progressive motor neuron loss and associated inflammation represent major pathology hallmarks. Both the prevention of neuronal loss and neuro-destructive inflammation are still unmet challenges. Medical ozone, an ozonized oxygen mixture (O3/O2), has been shown to elicit profound immunomodulatory effects in peripheral organs, and beneficial effects in the aging brain. We investigated, in a preclinical drug testing approach, the therapeutic potential of a five-day O3/O2i.p. treatment regime at the beginning of the symptomatic disease phase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G93A)) ALS mouse model. Clinical assessment of SOD1(G93A) mice revealed no benefit of medical ozone treatment over sham with respect to gross body weight, motor performance, disease duration, or survival. In the brainstem of end stage SOD1(G93A) mice, however, neurodegeneration was found decelerated, and SOD1-related vacuolization was reduced in the motor trigeminal nucleus in the O3/O2 treatment group when compared to sham-treated mice. In addition, microglia proliferation was less pronounced in the brainstem, while the hypertrophy of astroglia remained largely unaffected. Finally, monocyte numbers were reduced in the blood, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes at postnatal day 60 in SOD1(G93A) mice. A further decrease in monocyte numbers seen in mesenteric lymph nodes from sham-treated SOD1(G93A) mice at an advanced disease stage, however, was prevented by medical ozone treatment. Collectively, our study revealed a select neuroprotective and possibly anti-inflammatory capacity for medical ozone when applied as a therapeutic agent in SOD1(G93A) ALS mice.

%X BACKGROUND: Missing or incomplete phenotypic information can severely deteriorate the statistical power in epidemiological studies. High-throughput quantification of small-molecules in bio-samples, i.e. 'metabolomics', is steadily gaining popularity, as it is highly informative for various phenotypical characteristics. Here we aim to leverage metabolomics to impute missing data in clinical variables routinely assessed in large epidemiological and clinical studies. METHODS: To this end, we have employed approximately 26,000 (1)H-NMR metabolomics samples from 28 Dutch cohorts collected within the BBMRI-NL consortium, to create 19 metabolomics-based predictors for clinical variables, including diabetes status (AUC5-Fold CV = 0.94) and lipid medication usage (AUC5-Fold CV = 0.90). FINDINGS: Subsequent application in independent cohorts confirmed that our metabolomics-based predictors can indeed be used to impute a wide array of missing clinical variables from a single metabolomics data resource. In addition, application highlighted the potential use of our predictors to explore the effects of totally unobserved confounders in omics association studies. Finally, we show that our predictors can be used to explore risk factor profiles contributing to mortality in older participants. INTERPRETATION: To conclude, we provide (1)H-NMR metabolomics-based models to impute clinical variables routinely assessed in epidemiological studies and illustrate their merit in scenarios when phenotypic variables are partially incomplete or totally unobserved.

%X MOTIVATION: 1H-NMR metabolomics is rapidly becoming a standard resource in large epidemiological studies to acquire metabolic profiles in large numbers of samples in a relatively low-priced and standardized manner. Concomitantly, metabolomics-based models are increasingly developed that capture disease risk or clinical risk factors. These developments raise the need for user-friendly toolbox to inspect new 1H-NMR metabolomics data and project a wide array of previously established risk models. RESULTS: We present MiMIR (Metabolomics-based Models for Imputing Risk), a graphical user interface that provides an intuitive framework for ad-hoc statistical analysis of Nightingale Health's 1H-NMR metabolomics data and allows for the projection and calibration of 24 pre-trained metabolomics-based models, without any pre-required programming knowledge. AVAILABILITY: The R-shiny package is available in CRAN or downloadable at https://github.com/DanieleBizzarri/MiMIR, together with an extensive user manual (also available as Supplementary Documents to the paper). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

%X Regulation of gene expression is linked to the organization of the genome. With age, chromatin alterations occur on all levels of genome organization, accompanied by changes in the gene expression profile. However, little is known about the changes in the level of transcriptional regulation. Here, we used a multi-omics approach and integrated ATAC-, RNA- and NET-seq to identify age-related changes in the chromatin landscape of murine liver and to investigate how these are linked to transcriptional regulation. We provide the first systematic inventory of the connection between aging, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation in a whole tissue. Aging in murine liver is characterized by an increase in chromatin accessibility at promoter regions, but not in an increase in transcriptional output. Instead, aging is accompanied by a decrease in promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), while initiation of transcription is not decreased as assessed by RNA polymerase mapping using CUT&RUN. Based on the data reported, we propose that these age-related changes in transcriptional regulation are due to a reduced stability of the pausing complex.

%X Aging individuals exhibit a pervasive decline in adaptive immune function, with important implications for health and lifespan. Previous studies have found a pervasive loss of immune-repertoire diversity in human peripheral blood during aging; however, little is known about repertoire aging in other immune compartments, or in species other than humans. Here, we perform the first study of immune-repertoire aging in an emerging model of vertebrate aging, the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri). Despite their extremely short lifespans, these killifish exhibit complex and individualized heavy-chain repertoires, with a generative process capable of producing millions of distinct productive sequences. Whole-body killifish repertoires decline rapidly in within-individual diversity with age, while between-individual variability increases. Large, expanded B-cell clones exhibit far greater diversity loss with age than small clones, suggesting important differences in how age affects different B-cell populations. The immune repertoires of isolated intestinal samples exhibit especially dramatic age-related diversity loss, related to an elevated prevalence of expanded clones. Lower intestinal repertoire diversity was also associated with transcriptomic signatures of reduced B-cell activity, supporting a functional role for diversity changes in killifish immunosenescence. Our results highlight important differences in systemic vs. organ-specific aging dynamics in the adaptive immune system.

%X Cellular processes can be regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms. We have recently shown that the small, noncoding vault RNA1-1 negatively riboregulates p62 oligomerization in selective autophagy through direct interaction with the autophagic receptor. This function is highly specific for this Pol III transcript, but the determinants of this specificity and a mechanistic explanation of how vault RNA1-1 inhibits p62 oligomerization are lacking. Here, we combine biochemical and functional experiments to answer these questions. We show that the PB1 domain and adjacent linker region of p62 (aa 1-122) are necessary and sufficient for specific vault RNA1-1 binding, and we identify lysine 7 and arginine 21 as key hinges for p62 riboregulation. Chemical structure probing of vault RNA1-1 further reveals a central flexible loop within vault RNA1-1 that is required for the specific interaction with p62. Overall, our data provide molecular insight into how a small RNA riboregulates protein-protein interactions critical to the activation of specific autophagy.

%X <i>Candida</i> spp. represent the third most frequent worldwide cause of infection in Intensive Care Units with a mortality rate of almost 40%. The classes of antifungals currently available include azoles, polyenes, echinocandins, pyrimidine derivatives, and allylamines. However, the therapeutical options for the treatment of candidiasis are drastically reduced by the increasing antifungal resistance. The growing need for a more targeted antifungal therapy is limited by the concern of finding molecules that specifically recognize the microbial cell without damaging the host. Epigenetic writers and erasers have emerged as promising targets in different contexts, including the treatment of fungal infections. In <i>C. albicans</i>, Hst3p, a sirtuin that deacetylates H3K56ac, represents an attractive antifungal target as it is essential for the fungus viability and virulence. Although the relevance of such epigenetic regulator is documented for the development of new antifungal therapies, the molecular mechanism behind Hst3p-mediated epigenetic regulation remains unrevealed. Here, we provide the first genome-wide profiling of H3K56ac in <i>C. albicans</i> resulting in H3K56ac enriched regions associated with <i>Candida</i> sp. pathogenicity. Upon Hst3p inhibition, 447 regions gain H3K56ac. Importantly, these genomic areas contain genes encoding for adhesin proteins, degradative enzymes, and white-opaque switching. Moreover, our RNA-seq analysis revealed 1330 upregulated and 1081 downregulated transcripts upon Hst3p inhibition, and among them, we identified 87 genes whose transcriptional increase well correlates with the enrichment of H3K56 acetylation on their promoters, including some well-known regulators of phenotypic switching and virulence. Based on our evidence, Hst3p is an appealing target for the development of new potential antifungal drugs.

%X The mitochondrial integrated stress response (mitoISR) has emerged as a major adaptive pathway to respiratory chain deficiency, but both the tissue specificity of its regulation, and how mitoISR adapts to different levels of mitochondrial dysfunction are largely unknown. Here, we report that diverse levels of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy activate mitoISR, including high production of FGF21, a cytokine with both paracrine and endocrine function, shown to be induced by respiratory chain dysfunction. Although being fully dispensable for the cell-autonomous and systemic responses to severe mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, in the conditions of mild-to-moderate cardiac OXPHOS dysfunction, FGF21 regulates a portion of mitoISR. In the absence of FGF21, a large part of the metabolic adaptation to mitochondrial dysfunction (one-carbon metabolism, transsulfuration, and serine and proline biosynthesis) is strongly blunted, independent of the primary mitoISR activator ATF4. Collectively, our work highlights the complexity of mitochondrial stress responses by revealing the importance of the tissue specificity and dose dependency of mitoISR.

%X Mutations causing loss of the NF-kappaB regulator IkappaBNS, result in impaired development of innate-like B cells and defective plasma cell (PC) differentiation. Since productive PC differentiation requires B cell metabolic reprogramming, we sought to investigate processes important for this transition using the bumble mouse strain, deficient for IkappaBNS. We report that LPS-activated bumble B cells exhibited elevated mTOR activation levels, mitochondrial accumulation, increased OXPHOS and mROS production, along with a reduced capacity for autophagy, compared to wildtype B cells. Overall, our results demonstrate that PC differentiation in the absence of IkappaBNS is characterized by excessive activation during early rounds of B cell division, increased mitochondrial metabolism and decreased autophagic capacity, thus improving our understanding of the role of IkappaBNS in PC differentiation.

%X Abstract Genetic, environmental, and pharmacological interventions into the aging process can confer resistance to multiple age-related diseases in laboratory animals, including rhesus monkeys. These findings imply that individual mechanisms of aging might contribute to the co-occurrence of age-related diseases in humans and could be targeted to prevent these conditions simultaneously. To address this question, we text mined 917,645 literature abstracts followed by manual curation and found strong, non-random associations between age-related diseases and aging mechanisms in humans, confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis of GWAS data. Integration of these associations with clinical data from 3.01 million patients showed that age-related diseases associated with each of five aging mechanisms were more likely than chance to be present together in patients. Genetic evidence revealed that innate and adaptive immunity, the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway and activity of the ERK1/2 pathway were associated with multiple aging mechanisms and diverse age-related diseases. Mechanisms of aging hence contribute both together and individually to age-related disease co-occurrence in humans and could potentially be targeted accordingly to prevent multimorbidity.

%X BACKGROUND: Cancer-related muscle wasting occurs in most cancer patients. An important regulator of adult muscle mass and function is the Akt-mTORC1 pathway. While Akt-mTORC1 signalling is important for adult muscle homeostasis, it is also a major target of numerous cancer treatments. Which role Akt-mTORC1 signalling plays during cancer cachexia in muscle is currently not known. Here, we aimed to determine how activation or inactivation of the pathway affects skeletal muscle during cancer cachexia. METHODS: We used inducible, muscle-specific Raptor ko (mTORC1) mice to determine the effect of reduced mTOR signalling during cancer cachexia. On the contrary, in order to understand if skeletal muscles maintain their anabolic capacity and if activation of Akt-mTORC1 signalling can reverse cancer cachexia, we generated mice in which we can inducibly activate Akt specifically in skeletal muscles. RESULTS: We found that mTORC1 signalling is impaired during cancer cachexia, using the Lewis lung carcinoma and C26 colon cancer model, and is accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis rates of 57% (P < 0.01). Further reduction of mTOR signalling, as seen in Raptor ko animals, leads to a 1.5-fold increase in autophagic flux (P > 0.001), but does not further increase muscle wasting. On the other hand, activation of Akt-mTORC1 signalling in already cachectic animals completely reverses the 15-20% loss in muscle mass and force (P < 0.001). Interestingly, Akt activation only in skeletal muscle completely normalizes the transcriptional deregulation observed in cachectic muscle, despite having no effect on tumour size or spleen mass. In addition to stimulating muscle growth, it is also sufficient to prevent the increase in protein degradation normally observed in muscles from tumour-bearing animals. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that activation of Akt-mTORC1 signalling is sufficient to completely revert cancer-dependent muscle wasting. Intriguingly, these results show that skeletal muscle maintains its anabolic capacities also during cancer cachexia, possibly giving a rationale behind some of the beneficial effects observed in exercise in cancer patients.

%X Amino acid availability controls mTORC1 activity via a heterodimeric Rag GTPase complex that functions as a scaffold at the lysosomal surface, bringing together mTORC1 with its activators and effectors. Mammalian cells express four Rag proteins (RagA-D) that form dimers composed of RagA/B bound to RagC/D. Traditionally, the Rag paralogue pairs (RagA/B and RagC/D) are referred to as functionally redundant, with the four dimer combinations used interchangeably in most studies. Here, by using genetically modified cell lines that express single Rag heterodimers, we uncover a Rag dimer code that determines how amino acids regulate mTORC1. First, RagC/D differentially define the substrate specificity downstream of mTORC1, with RagD promoting phosphorylation of its lysosomal substrates TFEB/TFE3, while both Rags are involved in the phosphorylation of non-lysosomal substrates such as S6K. Mechanistically, RagD recruits mTORC1 more potently to lysosomes through increased affinity to the anchoring LAMTOR complex. Furthermore, RagA/B specify the signalling response to amino acid removal, with RagB-expressing cells maintaining lysosomal and active mTORC1 even upon starvation. Overall, our findings reveal key qualitative differences between Rag paralogues in the regulation of mTORC1, and underscore Rag gene duplication and diversification as a potentially impactful event in mammalian evolution.

%X Genomic variation impacts on cellular networks by affecting the abundance (e.g., protein levels) and the functional states (e.g., protein phosphorylation) of their components. Previous work has focused on the former, while in this context, the functional states of proteins have largely remained neglected. Here, we generated high-quality transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome data for a panel of 112 genomically well-defined yeast strains. Genetic effects on transcripts were generally transmitted to the protein layer, but specific gene groups, such as ribosomal proteins, showed diverging effects on protein levels compared with RNA levels. Phosphorylation states proved crucial to unravel genetic effects on signaling networks. Correspondingly, genetic variants that cause phosphorylation changes were mostly different from those causing abundance changes in the respective proteins. Underscoring their relevance for cell physiology, phosphorylation traits were more strongly correlated with cell physiological traits such as chemical compound resistance or cell morphology, compared with transcript or protein abundance. This study demonstrates how molecular networks mediate the effects of genomic variants to cellular traits and highlights the particular importance of protein phosphorylation.

%X The mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is the central region in the physiological response to metabolic stress. The FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a major modulator of the stress response and has recently emerged as a scaffolder regulating metabolic and autophagy pathways. However, the detailed protein-protein interactions linking FKBP51 to autophagy upon metabolic challenges remain elusive. We performed mass spectrometry-based metabolomics of FKBP51 knockout (KO) cells revealing an increased amino acid and polyamine metabolism. We identified FKBP51 as a central nexus for the recruitment of the LKB1/AMPK complex to WIPI4 and TSC2 to WIPI3, thereby regulating the balance between autophagy and mTOR signaling in response to metabolic challenges. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MBH FKBP51 deletion strongly induces obesity, while its overexpression protects against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Our study provides an important novel regulatory function of MBH FKBP51 within the stress-adapted autophagy response to metabolic challenges.

%X PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the approval of novel vaccines with different mechanisms of action. Until now, more than 4.7 billion persons have been vaccinated around the world, and adverse effects not observed in pre-authorization trials are being reported at low frequency. METHODS: We report a case of severe hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) after SARS-CoV-2 immunization and performed a literature search for all reported cases of COVID-19 vaccine-associated HLH. RESULTS: A 24-year-old female developed HLH after immunization with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty. Diagnosis was made according to HLH-2004 criteria; the HScore was 259 (> 99% HLH probability) with maximum ferritin of 138.244 µg/L. The patient was initially treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) and dexamethasone without response. The addition of the human interleukin 1 receptor antagonist Anakinra resulted in full recovery within 6 weeks after vaccination. A literature search revealed 15 additional cases of HLH after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, the majority after immunization with Comirnaty (n = 7) or the viral vector vaccine Vaxzevria (n = 6). Treatment modalities included corticosteroids (n = 13), Anakinra (n = 5), IVIGs (n = 5), and etoposide (n = 2). Eight patients underwent combination treatment. Three of 16 patients died. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccines may occasionally trigger HLH, and Anakinra may be an efficacious treatment option for this condition.

%X Differentiating stem cells must coordinate their metabolism and fate trajectories. Here, we report that the catalytic activity of the glycolytic enzyme Enolase 1 (ENO1) is directly regulated by RNAs leading to metabolic rewiring in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We identify RNA ligands that specifically inhibit ENO1's enzymatic activity in vitro and diminish glycolysis in cultured human cells and mESCs. Pharmacological inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of the protein deacetylase SIRT2 increases ENO1's acetylation and enhances its RNA binding. Similarly, induction of mESC differentiation leads to increased ENO1 acetylation, enhanced RNA binding, and inhibition of glycolysis. Stem cells expressing mutant forms of ENO1 that escape or hyper-activate this regulation display impaired germ layer differentiation. Our findings uncover acetylation-driven riboregulation of ENO1 as a physiological mechanism of glycolytic control and of the regulation of stem cell differentiation. Riboregulation may represent a more widespread principle of biological control.

%X Mitoribosomes are essential for the synthesis and maintenance of bioenergetic proteins. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine a series of the small mitoribosomal subunit (SSU) intermediates in complex with auxiliary factors, revealing a sequential assembly mechanism. The methyltransferase TFB1M binds to partially unfolded rRNA h45 that is promoted by RBFA, while the mRNA channel is blocked. This enables binding of METTL15 that promotes further rRNA maturation and a large conformational change of RBFA. The new conformation allows initiation factor mtIF3 to already occupy the subunit interface during the assembly. Finally, the mitochondria-specific ribosomal protein mS37 (ref. (1)) outcompetes RBFA to complete the assembly with the SSU-mS37-mtIF3 complex(2) that proceeds towards mtIF2 binding and translation initiation. Our results explain how the action of step-specific factors modulate the dynamic assembly of the SSU, and adaptation of a unique protein, mS37, links the assembly to initiation to establish the catalytic human mitoribosome.

%X Ubiquilin-4 (UBQLN4) is a proteasomal shuttle factor that directly binds to ubiquitylated proteins and delivers its cargo to the 26S proteasome for degradation. We previously showed that upregulated UBQLN4 determines the DNA damage response (DDR) through the degradation of MRE11A. However, the regulatory mechanism at DNA level, transcriptionally and post-transcriptional levels that control UBQLN4 mRNA levels remains unknown. In this study, we screened 32 solid tumor types and validated our findings by immunohistochemistry analysis. UBQLN4 is upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels and the most significant values were observed in liver, breast, ovarian, lung, and esophageal cancers. Patients with high UBQLN4 mRNA levels had significantly poor prognoses in 20 of 32 cancer types. DNA amplification was identified as the main mechanism promoting UBQLN4 upregulation in multiple cancers, even in the early phases of tumor development. Using CRISPR screen datasets, UBQLN4 was identified as a common essential gene for tumor cell viability in 81.1% (860/1,060) of the solid tumor derived cell lines. Ovarian cancer cell lines with high UBQLN4 mRNA levels were platinum-based chemotherapy resistant, while they were more sensitive to poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Our findings highlight the utilities of UBQLN4 as a significant pan-cancer theranostic factor and a precision oncology biomarker for DDR-related drug resistance.

%X Caloric Restriction (CR) extends lifespan and augments cellular stress-resistance from yeast to primates, making CR an attractive strategy for organ protection in the clinic. Translation of CR to patients is complex, due to problems regarding adherence, feasibility and safety concerns in frail patients. Novel tailored dietary regimens, which modulate the dietary composition of macro- and micronutrients rather than reducing calorie intake promise similar protective effects and increased translatability. However, a direct head-to-head comparison to identify the most potent approach for organ protection as well as overlapping metabolic consequences has not been performed. We systematically analyzed six dietary preconditioning protocols - fasting mimicking diet (FMD), ketogenic diet (KD), dietary restriction of branched chained amino acids (BCAA), two dietary regimens restricting sulfur-containing amino acids (SR80/100) and CR - in a rodent model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) to quantify diet-induced resilience in kidneys. Of the administered diets, FMD, SR80/100 and CR efficiently protect from kidney damage after IRI. Interestingly, these approaches show overlapping changes in oxidative and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-dependent cysteine catabolism as a potential common mechanism of organ protection.

%X The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) produces the essential metabolite UDP-GlcNAc and plays a key role in metabolism, health, and aging. The HBP is controlled by its rate-limiting enzyme glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFPT/GFAT) that is directly inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc in a feedback loop. HBP regulation by GFPT is well studied but other HBP regulators have remained obscure. Elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels counteract the glycosylation toxin tunicamycin (TM), and thus we screened for TM resistance in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using random chemical mutagenesis to determine alternative HBP regulation. We identified the N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase AMDHD2 that catalyzes a reverse reaction in the HBP and its loss strongly elevated UDP-GlcNAc. To better understand AMDHD2, we solved the crystal structure and found that loss-of-function (LOF) is caused by protein destabilization or interference with its catalytic activity. Finally, we show that mESCs express AMDHD2 together with GFPT2 instead of the more common paralog GFPT1. Compared with GFPT1, GFPT2 had a much lower sensitivity to UDP-GlcNAc inhibition, explaining how AMDHD2 LOF resulted in HBP activation. This HBP configuration in which AMDHD2 serves to balance GFPT2 activity was also observed in other mESCs and, consistently, the GFPT2:GFPT1 ratio decreased with differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. Taken together, our data reveal a critical function of AMDHD2 in limiting UDP-GlcNAc production in cells that use GFPT2 for metabolite entry into the HBP.

%X BACKGROUND: Globally, there is a paucity of multimorbidity and comorbidity data, especially for minority ethnic groups and younger people. We estimated the frequency of common disease combinations and identified non-random disease associations for all ages in a multiethnic population. METHODS: In this population-based study, we examined multimorbidity and comorbidity patterns stratified by ethnicity or race, sex, and age for 308 health conditions using electronic health records from individuals included on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked with the Hospital Episode Statistics admitted patient care dataset in England. We included individuals who were older than 1 year and who had been registered for at least 1 year in a participating general practice during the study period (between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2015). We identified the most common combinations of conditions and comorbidities for index conditions. We defined comorbidity as the accumulation of additional conditions to an index condition over an individual's lifetime. We used network analysis to identify conditions that co-occurred more often than expected by chance. We developed online interactive tools to explore multimorbidity and comorbidity patterns overall and by subgroup based on ethnicity, sex, and age. FINDINGS: We collected data for 3 872 451 eligible patients, of whom 1 955 700 (50.5%) were women and girls, 1 916 751 (49.5%) were men and boys, 2 666 234 (68.9%) were White, 155 435 (4.0%) were south Asian, and 98 815 (2.6%) were Black. We found that a higher proportion of boys aged 1-9 years (132 506 [47.8%] of 277 158) had two or more diagnosed conditions than did girls in the same age group (106 982 [40.3%] of 265 179), but more women and girls were diagnosed with multimorbidity than were boys aged 10 years and older and men (1 361 232 [80.5%] of 1 690 521 vs 1 161 308 [70.8%] of 1 639 593). White individuals (2 097 536 [78.7%] of 2 666 234) were more likely to be diagnosed with two or more conditions than were Black (59 339 [60.1%] of 98 815) or south Asian individuals (93 617 [60.2%] of 155 435). Depression commonly co-occurred with anxiety, migraine, obesity, atopic conditions, deafness, soft-tissue disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders across all subgroups. Heart failure often co-occurred with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteoarthritis, stable angina, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Spinal fractures were most strongly non-randomly associated with malignancy in Black individuals, but with osteoporosis in White individuals. Hypertension was most strongly associated with kidney disorders in those aged 20-29 years, but with dyslipidaemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes in individuals aged 40 years and older. Breast cancer was associated with different comorbidities in individuals from different ethnic groups. Asthma was associated with different comorbidities between males and females. Bipolar disorder was associated with different comorbidities in younger age groups compared with older age groups. INTERPRETATION: Our findings and interactive online tools are a resource for: patients and their clinicians, to prevent and detect comorbid conditions; research funders and policy makers, to redesign service provision, training priorities, and guideline development; and biomedical researchers and manufacturers of medicines, to provide leads for research into common or sequential pathways of disease and inform the design of clinical trials.

%X The RAS/MAPK pathway is a highly conserved signalling pathway with a well-established role in cancer. Mutations that hyperactivate this pathway are associated with unregulated cell proliferation. Evidence from a range of model organisms also links RAS/MAPK signalling to ageing. Genetic approaches that reduce RAS/MAPK signalling activity extend lifespan and also improve healthspan, delaying the onset and/or progression of age-related functional decline. Given its role in cancer, therapeutic interventions that target and inhibit this pathway's key components are under intense investigation. The consequent availability of small molecule inhibitors raises the possibility of repurposing these compounds to ameliorate the deleterious effects of ageing. Here, we review evidence that RAS/MAPK signalling inhibitors already in clinical use, such as trametinib, acarbose, statins, metformin and dihydromyricetin, lead to lifespan extension and to improved healthspan in a range of model systems. These findings suggest that the repurposing of small molecule inhibitors of RAS/MAPK signalling might offer opportunities to improve health during ageing, and to delay or prevent the development of age-related disease. However, challenges to this approach, including poor tolerance to treatment in older adults or development of drug resistance, first need to be resolved before successful clinical implementation.

%X Apicomplexan parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, have specific adaptations that enable invasion and exit from the host cell. Owing to the phylogenetic distance between apicomplexan parasites and model organisms, comparative genomics has limited capacity to infer gene functions. Further, although CRISPR/Cas9-based screens have assigned roles to some Toxoplasma genes, the functions of encoded proteins have proven difficult to assign. To overcome this problem, we devised a conditional Cas9-system in T. gondii that enables phenotypic screens. Using an indicator strain for F-actin dynamics and apicoplast segregation, we screened 320 genes to identify those required for defined steps in the asexual life cycle. The detailed characterization of two genes identified in our screen, through the generation of conditional knockout parasites using the DiCre-system, revealed that signalling linking factor (SLF) is an integral part of a signalling complex required for early induction of egress, and a novel conoid protein (conoid gliding protein, CGP) functions late during egress and is required for the activation of gliding motility. Establishing different indicator lines and applying our conditional Cas9 screen could enable the identification of genes involved in organellar biogenesis, parasite replication or maintenance of the endosymbiotic organelles in the future.

%X The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is essential for cellular homeostasis. Yet little is known of the mechanisms that remodel it during natural stresses. We found that large "SPOTs" (structures positive for OMM) emerge during Toxoplasma gondii infection in mammalian cells. SPOTs mediated the depletion of the OMM proteins mitofusin 1 and 2, which restrict parasite growth. The formation of SPOTs depended on the parasite effector TgMAF1 and the host mitochondrial import receptor TOM70, which is required for optimal parasite proliferation. TOM70 enabled TgMAF1 to interact with the host OMM translocase SAM50. The ablation of SAM50 or the overexpression of an OMM-targeted protein promoted OMM remodeling independently of infection. Thus, Toxoplasma hijacks the formation of SPOTs, a cellular response to OMM stress, to promote its growth.

%X ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a widespread post-translational modification (PTM) spanning all kingdoms of life. It is employed by bacteria and viruses in their war against the host, and by eukaryotes to regulate many physiological processes, across almost all cellular compartments. PARP1, the founding member of the PARP family, is an early sensor of single- and double-strand breaks and catalyzes ADPr to mediate DNA damage repair. The recent discovery of Serine-ADPr and the PARP1 accessory factor HPF1 has brought a momentous change to the field. Bolstered by innovative ways to study ADPr, new and exciting research directions are rapidly emerging. In this review we explore our understanding of the HPF1/PARP1-mediated ADPr signaling pathway in DNA damage. We focus on the mechanistic steps leading to Serine-ADPr and its relevance in the DNA damage response. We discuss important technological advances that have enabled a nuanced study of Serine-ADPr, and conclude with an overview of the role of PARP inhibitors in cancer therapy.

%X SignificanceThe pseudokinase integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a central component of focal adhesions, cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes that integrate and transduce biochemical and mechanical signals from the extracellular environment into the cell and vice versa. However, the precise molecular functions, particularly the mechanosensory properties of ILK and the significance of retained adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding, are still unclear. Combining molecular-dynamics simulations with cell biology, we establish a role for ATP binding to pseudokinases. We find that ATP promotes the structural stability of ILK, allosterically influences the interaction between ILK and its binding partner parvin at adhesions, and enhances the mechanoresistance of this complex. On the cellular level, ATP binding facilitates efficient traction force buildup, focal adhesion stabilization, and efficient cell migration.

%X Cancer cells depend on mitochondria to sustain their increased metabolic need and mitochondria therefore constitute possible targets for cancer treatment. We recently developed small-molecule inhibitors of mitochondrial transcription (IMTs) that selectively impair mitochondrial gene expression. IMTs have potent antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo, without affecting normal tissues. Because therapy-induced resistance is a major constraint to successful cancer therapy, we investigated mechanisms conferring resistance to IMTs. We employed a CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-(CRISP-associated protein 9) whole-genome screen to determine pathways conferring resistance to acute IMT1 treatment. Loss of genes belonging to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways caused resistance to acute IMT1 treatment and the relevance of these pathways was confirmed by chemical modulation. We also generated cells resistant to chronic IMT treatment to understand responses to persistent mitochondrial gene expression impairment. We report that IMT1-acquired resistance occurs through a compensatory increase of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expression and cellular metabolites. We found that mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) downregulation and inhibition of mitochondrial translation impaired survival of resistant cells. The identified susceptibility and resistance mechanisms to IMTs may be relevant for different types of mitochondria-targeted therapies.

%X Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance disorders are caused by mutations in ubiquitously expressed nuclear genes and lead to syndromes with variable disease severity and tissue-specific phenotypes. Loss of function mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial genome and maintenance exonuclease 1 (MGME1) result in deletions and depletion of mtDNA leading to adult-onset multisystem mitochondrial disease in humans. To better understand the in vivo function of MGME1 and the associated disease pathophysiology, we characterized a Mgme1 mouse knockout model by extensive phenotyping of ageing knockout animals. We show that loss of MGME1 leads to de novo formation of linear deleted mtDNA fragments that are constantly made and degraded. These findings contradict previous proposal that MGME1 is essential for degradation of linear mtDNA fragments and instead support a model where MGME1 has a critical role in completion of mtDNA replication. We report that Mgme1 knockout mice develop a dramatic phenotype as they age and display progressive weight loss, cataract and retinopathy. Surprisingly, aged animals also develop kidney inflammation, glomerular changes and severe chronic progressive nephropathy, consistent with nephrotic syndrome. These findings link the faulty mtDNA synthesis to severe inflammatory disease and thus show that defective mtDNA replication can trigger an immune response that causes age-associated progressive pathology in the kidney.

%X The PRELID-TRIAP1 family of proteins is responsible for lipid transfer in mitochondria. Multiple structures have been resolved of apo and lipid substrate bound forms, allowing us to begin to piece together the molecular level details of the full lipid transfer cycle. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that the lipid binding is mediated by an extended, water-mediated hydrogen bonding network. A key mutation, R53E, was found to disrupt this network, causing lipid to be released from the complex. The X-ray crystal structure of R53E was captured in a fully closed and apo state. Lipid transfer assays and molecular simulations allow us to interpret the observed conformation in the context of the biological role. Together, our work provides further understanding of the mechanistic control of lipid transport by PRELID-TRIAP1 in mitochondria.

%X Mitochondria are central hubs for cellular metabolism, coordinating a variety of metabolic reactions crucial for human health. Mitochondria provide most of the cellular energy via their oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which requires the coordinated expression of genes encoded by both the nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). Transcription of mtDNA is not only essential for the biogenesis of the OXPHOS system, but also generates RNA primers necessary to initiate mtDNA replication. Like the prokaryotic system, mitochondria have no membrane-based compartmentalization to separate the different steps of mtDNA maintenance and expression and depend entirely on nDNA-encoded factors imported into the organelle. Our understanding of mitochondrial transcription in mammalian cells has largely progressed, but the mechanisms regulating mtDNA gene expression are still poorly understood despite their profound importance for human disease. Here, we review mechanisms of mitochondrial gene expression with a focus on the recent findings in the field of mammalian mtDNA transcription and disease phenotypes caused by defects in proteins involved in this process.

%X Cells generate and sense mechanical forces that trigger biochemical signals to elicit cellular responses that control cell fate changes. Mechanical forces also physically distort neighboring cells and the surrounding connective tissue, which propagate mechanochemical signals over long distances to guide tissue patterning, organogenesis, and adult tissue homeostasis. As the largest and stiffest organelle, the nucleus is particularly sensitive to mechanical force and deformation. Nuclear responses to mechanical force include adaptations in chromatin architecture and transcriptional activity that trigger changes in cell state. These force-driven changes also influence the mechanical properties of chromatin and nuclei themselves to prevent aberrant alterations in nuclear shape and help maintain genome integrity. This review will discuss principles of nuclear mechanotransduction and chromatin mechanics and their role in DNA damage and cell fate regulation.

%X The in vivo role for RNase H1 in mammalian mitochondria has been much debated. Loss of RNase H1 is embryonic lethal and to further study its role in mtDNA expression we characterized a conditional knockout of Rnaseh1 in mouse heart. We report that RNase H1 is essential for processing of RNA primers to allow site-specific initiation of mtDNA replication. Without RNase H1, the RNA:DNA hybrids at the replication origins are not processed and mtDNA replication is initiated at non-canonical sites and becomes impaired. Importantly, RNase H1 is also needed for replication completion and in its absence linear deleted mtDNA molecules extending between the two origins of mtDNA replication are formed accompanied by mtDNA depletion. The steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts follow the levels of mtDNA, and RNA processing is not altered in the absence of RNase H1. Finally, we report the first patient with a homozygous pathogenic mutation in the hybrid-binding domain of RNase H1 causing impaired mtDNA replication. In contrast to catalytically inactive variants of RNase H1, this mutant version has enhanced enzyme activity but shows impaired primer formation. This finding shows that the RNase H1 activity must be strictly controlled to allow proper regulation of mtDNA replication.

%X Microglial research has advanced considerably in recent decades yet has been constrained by a rolling series of dichotomies such as "resting versus activated" and "M1 versus M2." This dualistic classification of good or bad microglia is inconsistent with the wide repertoire of microglial states and functions in development, plasticity, aging, and diseases that were elucidated in recent years. New designations continuously arising in an attempt to describe the different microglial states, notably defined using transcriptomics and proteomics, may easily lead to a misleading, although unintentional, coupling of categories and functions. To address these issues, we assembled a group of multidisciplinary experts to discuss our current understanding of microglial states as a dynamic concept and the importance of addressing microglial function. Here, we provide a conceptual framework and recommendations on the use of microglial nomenclature for researchers, reviewers, and editors, which will serve as the foundations for a future white paper.

%X Aging research is unparalleled in the breadth of disciplines it encompasses, from evolutionary studies examining the forces that shape aging to molecular studies uncovering the underlying mechanisms of age-related functional decline. Despite a common focus to advance our understanding of aging, these disciplines have proceeded along distinct paths with little cross-talk. We propose that the concept of resilience can bridge this gap. Resilience describes the ability of a system to respond to perturbations by returning to its original state. Although resilience has been applied in a few individual disciplines in aging research such as frailty and cognitive decline, it has not been explored as a unifying conceptual framework that is able to connect distinct research fields. We argue that because a resilience-based framework can cross broad physiological levels and time scales it can provide the missing links that connect these diverse disciplines. The resulting framework will facilitate predictive modeling and validation and influence targets and directions in research on the biology of aging.

%X BACKGROUND: The majority of BRCA1-mutant breast cancers are characterized by a triple-negative phenotype and a basal-like molecular subtype, associated with aggressive clinical behavior. Current treatment options are limited, highlighting the need for the development of novel targeted therapies for this tumor subtype. METHODS: Our group previously showed that EZH2 is functionally relevant in BRCA1-deficient breast tumors and blocking EZH2 enzymatic activity could be a potent treatment strategy. To validate the role of EZH2 as a therapeutic target and to identify new synergistic drug combinations, we performed a high-throughput drug combination screen in various cell lines derived from BRCA1-deficient and -proficient mouse mammary tumors. RESULTS: We identified the combined inhibition of EZH2 and the proximal DNA damage response kinase ATM as a novel synthetic lethality-based therapy for the treatment of BRCA1-deficient breast tumors. We show that the combined treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 and the ATM inhibitor AZD1390 led to reduced colony formation, increased genotoxic stress, and apoptosis-mediated cell death in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells in vitro. These findings were corroborated by in vivo experiments showing that simultaneous inhibition of EZH2 and ATM significantly increased anti-tumor activity in mice bearing BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we identified a synthetic lethal interaction between EZH2 and ATM and propose this synergistic interaction as a novel molecular combination for the treatment of BRCA1-mutant breast cancer.

%X Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism is a central hub for energy production and regulation of numerous physiological processes. Controversially, both increased and decreased levels of BCAAs are associated with longevity. Using genetics and multi-omics analyses in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified adaptive regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in response to defective BCAA catabolic reactions after the initial transamination step. Worms with impaired BCAA metabolism show a slower turnover of a GFP-based proteasome substrate, which is suppressed by loss-of-function of the first BCAA catabolic enzyme, the branched-chain aminotransferase BCAT-1. The exogenous supply of BCAA-derived carboxylic acids, which are known to accumulate in the body fluid of patients with BCAA metabolic disorders, is sufficient to regulate the UPS. The link between BCAA intermediates and UPS function presented here sheds light on the unexplained role of BCAAs in the aging process and opens future possibilities for therapeutic interventions.

%X FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that represses the translation of specific mRNAs. In neurons, its depletion determines the exaggerated translation of mRNAs leading to dendritic and axonal aberrant development, two peculiar features of Fragile X syndrome patients. However, how FMRP binds to translational machinery to regulate the translation of its mRNA targets is not yet fully understood. Here, we show that FMRP localizes on translational machinery by interacting with the ribosomal binding protein, Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1). The binding of FMRP to RACK1 removes the translational repressive activity of FMRP and promotes the translation of PSD-95 mRNA, one specific target of FMRP. This binding also results in a reduction in the level of FMRP phosphorylation. We also find that the morphological abnormalities induced by Fmr1 siRNA in cortical neurons are rescued by the overexpression of a mutant form of RACK1 that cannot bind ribosomes. Thus, these results provide a new mechanism underlying FMRP activity that contributes to altered development in FXS. Moreover, these data confirm the role of ribosomal RACK1 as a ribosomal scaffold for RNA binding proteins.

%X Proliferating cells undergo metabolic changes in synchrony with cell cycle progression and cell division. Mitochondria provide fuel, metabolites, and ATP during different phases of the cell cycle, however it is not completely understood how mitochondrial function and the cell cycle are coordinated. CLUH is a post-transcriptional regulator of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and several metabolic pathways. Here, we show a role of CLUH in regulating the expression of astrin, which is involved in metaphase to anaphase progression, centrosome integrity, and mTORC1 inhibition. We find that CLUH binds both the SPAG5 mRNA and its product astrin, and controls the synthesis and the stability of the full-length astrin-1 isoform. We show that CLUH interacts with astrin-1 specifically during interphase. Astrin-depleted cells show mTORC1 hyperactivation and enhanced anabolism. On the other hand, cells lacking CLUH show decreased astrin levels and increased mTORC1 signaling, but cannot sustain anaplerotic and anabolic pathways. In absence of CLUH, cells fail to grow during G1, and progress faster through the cell cycle, indicating dysregulated matching of growth, metabolism and cell cycling. Our data reveal a role of CLUH in coupling growth signaling pathways and mitochondrial metabolism with cell cycle progression.

%X Transcriptional reprogramming plays a key role in drought stress responses, preceding the onset of morphological and physiological acclimation. The best-characterized signal regulating gene expression in response to drought is the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). ABA-regulated gene expression, biosynthesis and signaling are highly organized in a diurnal cycle, so that ABA-regulated physiological traits occur at the appropriate time of day. The mechanisms that underpin such diel oscillations in ABA signals are poorly characterized. Here we uncover GIGANTEA (GI) as a key gatekeeper of ABA-regulated transcriptional and physiological responses. Time-resolved gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing under different irrigation scenarios indicates that gi mutants produce an exaggerated ABA response, despite accumulating wild-type levels of ABA. Comparisons with ABA-deficient mutants confirm the role of GI in controlling ABA-regulated genes, and the analysis of leaf temperature, a read-out for transpiration, supports a role for GI in the control of ABA-regulated physiological processes. Promoter regions of GI/ABA-regulated transcripts are directly targeted by different classes of transcription factors (TFs), especially PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR and -BINDING FACTOR, together with GI itself. We propose a model whereby diel changes in GI control oscillations in ABA responses. Peak GI accumulation at midday contributes to establishing a phase of reduced ABA sensitivity and related physiological responses, by gating DNA binding or function of different classes of TFs that cooperate or compete with GI at target regions.

%X Restriction of amino acids in the diet can extend lifespan in diverse species ranging from flies to mammals. However, the role of individual amino acids and the underlying molecular mechanisms are only partially understood. The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase General Control Nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is a key sensor of amino acid deficiency and has been implicated in the response of lifespan to dietary restriction (DR). Here, we generated a novel Drosophila GCN2 null mutant and analyzed its response to individual amino acid deficiency. We show that GCN2 function is essential for fly development, longevity and feeding behaviour under long-term, but not short-term, deprivation of all individual essential amino acids (EAAs) except for methionine. GCN2 mutants were longer-lived than control flies and showed normal feeding behaviour under methionine restriction. Thus, in flies at least two systems regulate these responses to amino acid deprivation. Methionine deprivation acts via a GCN2-independent mechanism, while all other EAA are sensed by GCN2. Combined deficiency of methionine and a second EAA blocked the response of GCN2 mutants to methionine, suggesting that these two pathways are interconnected. Wild type flies showed a short-term rejection of food lacking individual EAA, followed by a long-term compensatory increase in food uptake. GCN2 mutants also showed a short-term rejection of food deprived of individual EAA, but were unable to mount the compensatory long-term increase in food uptake. Over-expression of the downstream transcription factor ATF4 partially rescued the response of feeding behaviour in GCN2 mutants to amino acid deficiency. Phenotypes of GCN2 mutants induced by leucine and tryptophan, but not isoleucine, deficiency were partially rescued by ATF4 over-expression. The exact function of GCN2 as an amino acid sensor in vivo and the downstream action of its transcription factor effector ATF4 are thus context-specific with respect to the EAA involved.

%X High-calorie diets and chronic stress are major contributors to the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. These two risk factors regulate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The present study showed a key role of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) in dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh)-expressing cells in the regulation of SNS activity. In a diet-induced obesity model, CB1 deletion from these cells protected mice from diet-induced weight gain by increasing sympathetic drive, resulting in reduced adipogenesis in white adipose tissue and enhanced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. The deletion of CB1 from catecholaminergic neurons increased the plasma norepinephrine levels, norepinephrine turnover, and sympathetic activity in the visceral fat, which coincided with lowered neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels in the visceral fat of the mutant mice compared with the controls. Furthermore, the mutant mice showed decreased plasma corticosterone levels. Our study provided new insight into the mechanisms underlying the roles of the endocannabinoid system in regulating energy balance, where the CB1 deletion in dbh-positive cells protected from diet-induced weight gain via multiple mechanisms, such as increased SNS activity, reduced NPY activity, and decreased basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity.

%X Potato is the most widely produced tuber crop worldwide. However, reconstructing the four haplotypes of its autotetraploid genome remained an unsolved challenge. Here, we report the 3.1 Gb haplotype-resolved (at 99.6% precision), chromosome-scale assembly of the potato cultivar 'Otava' based on high-quality long reads, single-cell sequencing of 717 pollen genomes and Hi-C data. Unexpectedly, ~50% of the genome was identical-by-descent due to recent inbreeding, which was contrasted by highly abundant structural rearrangements involving ~20% of the genome. Among 38,214 genes, only 54% were present in all four haplotypes with an average of 3.2 copies per gene. Taking the leaf transcriptome as an example, 11% of the genes were differently expressed in at least one haplotype, where 25% of them were likely regulated through allele-specific DNA methylation. Our work sheds light on the recent breeding history of potato, the functional organization of its tetraploid genome and has the potential to strengthen the future of genomics-assisted breeding.

%X Length and quality of life are important to us all, yet identification of promising drug targets for human aging using genetics has had limited success. In the present study, we combine six European-ancestry genome-wide association studies of human aging traits—healthspan, father and mother lifespan, exceptional longevity, frailty index and self-rated health—in a principal component framework that maximizes their shared genetic architecture. The first principal component (aging-GIP1) captures both length of life and indices of mental and physical wellbeing. We identify 27 genomic regions associated with aging-GIP1, and provide additional, independent evidence for an effect on human aging for loci near HTT and MAML3 using a study of Finnish and Japanese survival. Using proteome-wide, two-sample, Mendelian randomization and colocalization, we provide robust evidence for a detrimental effect of blood levels of apolipoprotein(a) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 on aging-GIP1. Together, our results demonstrate that combining multiple aging traits using genetic principal components enhances the power to detect biological targets for human aging.

%X Complement factor H (CFH) and its related proteins have an essential role in regulating the alternative pathway of the complement system. Mutations and structural variants (SVs) of the CFH gene cluster, consisting of CFH and its five related genes (CFHR1-5), have been reported in renal pathologies as well as in complex immune diseases like age-related macular degeneration and systemic lupus erythematosus. SV analysis of this cluster is challenging due to its high degree of sequence homology. Following first-line NGS gene panel sequencing, we applied Genomic Vision's Molecular Combing Technology, to detect and visualize SVs within the CFH gene cluster and resolve its structural haplotypes completely. This approach was tested in three patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and known SVs, and 18 patients with aHUS or complement factor 3 glomerulopathy with unknown CFH gene cluster haplotypes. Three SVs, a CFH/CFHR1 hybrid gene in two patients and a rare heterozygous CFHR4/CFHR1 deletion in trans with the common CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion in a third patient were newly identified. For the latter, the breakpoints were determined using a targeted enrichment approach for long DNA fragments (Samplix Xdrop) in combination with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Molecular combing in addition to NGS was able to improve the molecular genetic yield in this pilot study. This (cost-)effective approach warrants validation in larger cohorts with CFH/CFHR-associated disease.

%X OBJECTIVE: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which often progresses to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through a largely undefined mechanism. NASH and HCC depend on inflammatory signaling, whose master regulator is the NFkappaB transcription factor family, activated by canonical and non-canonical pathways. METHODS: Here, we investigated non-canonical NFkappaB-inducing kinase (NIK/MAP3K14) in metabolic NASH, NASH to HCC transition, and DEN-induced HCC. To this end, we performed dietary and chemical interventions in mice that were analyzed via single nucleus sequencing, gene expression and histochemical methods. Ultimately, we verified our mouse results in human patient samples. RESULTS: We revealed that hepatocyte-specific NIK deficiency (NIKLKO) ameliorated metabolic NASH complications and reduced hepatocarcinogenesis, independent of its role in the NFkappaB pathway. Instead, hepatic NIK attenuated hepatoprotective JAK2/STAT5 signaling that is a prerequisite for NASH and NASH to HCC progression in mice and humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest NIK-mediated inhibitory JAK2 phosphorylation at serine 633 that might be amenable for future therapeutic interventions in patients.

%X Ageing is a complex process with common and distinct features across tissues. Unveiling the underlying processes driving ageing in individual tissues is indispensable to decipher the mechanisms of organismal longevity. Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established model organism that has spearheaded ageing research with the discovery of numerous genetic pathways controlling its lifespan. However, it remains challenging to dissect the ageing of worm tissues due to the limited description of tissue pathology and access to tissue-specific molecular changes during ageing. In this study, we isolated cells from five major tissues in young and old worms and profiled the age-induced transcriptomic changes within these tissues. We observed a striking diversity of ageing across tissues and identified different sets of longevity regulators therein. In addition, we found novel tissue-specific factors, including irx-1 and myrf-2, which control the integrity of the intestinal barrier and sarcomere structure during ageing respectively. This study demonstrates the complexity of ageing across worm tissues and highlights the power of tissue-specific transcriptomic profiling during ageing, which can serve as a resource to the field.

%X The transition between quiescence and activation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) is coupled with reversible changes in energy metabolism with key implications for lifelong NSPC self-renewal and neurogenesis. How this metabolic plasticity is ensured between NSPC activity states is unclear. We find that a state-specific rewiring of the mitochondrial proteome by the i-AAA peptidase YME1L is required to preserve NSPC self-renewal. YME1L controls the abundance of numerous mitochondrial substrates in quiescent NSPCs, and its deletion activates a differentiation program characterized by broad metabolic changes causing the irreversible shift away from a fatty-acid-oxidation-dependent state. Conditional Yme1l deletion in adult NSPCs in vivo results in defective self-renewal and premature differentiation, ultimately leading to NSPC pool depletion. Our results disclose an important role for YME1L in coordinating the switch between metabolic states of NSPCs and suggest that NSPC fate is regulated by compartmentalized changes in protein network dynamics.

%X In Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite of humans and other animals, host mitochondrial association (HMA) is driven by a gene family that encodes multiple mitochondrial association factor 1 (MAF1) proteins. However, the importance of MAF1 gene duplication in the evolution of HMA is not understood, nor is the impact of HMA on parasite biology. Here we used within- and between-species comparative analysis to determine that the MAF1 locus is duplicated in T. gondii and its nearest extant relative Hammondia hammondi, but not another close relative, Neospora caninum Using cross-species complementation, we determined that the MAF1 locus harbors multiple distinct paralogs that differ in their ability to mediate HMA, and that only T. gondii and H. hammondi harbor HMA(+) paralogs. Additionally, we found that exogenous expression of an HMA(+) paralog in T. gondii strains that do not normally exhibit HMA provides a competitive advantage over their wild-type counterparts during a mouse infection. These data indicate that HMA likely evolved by neofunctionalization of a duplicate MAF1 copy in the common ancestor of T. gondii and H. hammondi, and that the neofunctionalized gene duplicate is selectively advantageous.

%X Gene expression profiling provides a tool to analyze the internal states of cells or organisms, and their responses to perturbations. While global measurements of mRNA levels have thus been widely used for many years, it is only through the recent development of the ribosome profiling technique that an analogous examination of global mRNA translation programs has become possible. Ribosome profiling reveals which RNAs are being translated to what extent and where the translated open reading frames are located. In addition, different modes of translation regulation can be distinguished and characterized. Here, we present an optimized, step-by-step protocol for ribosome profiling. Although established in Caenorhabditis elegans, our protocol and optimization approaches should be equally usable for other model organisms or cell culture with little adaptation. Next to providing a protocol, we compare two different methods for isolation of single ribosomes and two different library preparations, and describe strategies to optimize the RNase digest and to reduce ribosomal RNA contamination in the libraries. Moreover, we discuss bioinformatic strategies to evaluate the quality of the data and explain how the data can be analyzed for different applications. In sum, this article seeks to facilitate the understanding, execution, and optimization of ribosome profiling experiments.

%X Type 2 diabetes mellitus affects 6% of western populations and represents a major risk factor for the development of skin complications, of which impaired wound healing, manifested in e.g. "diabetic foot ulcer", is most prominent. Impaired angiogenesis is considered a major contributing factor to these non-healing wounds. At present it is still unclear whether diabetes-associated wound healing and skin vascular dysfunction are direct consequences of impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling, or secondary due to e.g. hyperglycemia. To directly test the role of vascular endothelial insulin signaling in the development of diabetes-associated skin complications and vascular function, we inactivated the insulin receptor and its highly related receptor, the IGF-1 receptor, specifically in the endothelial compartment of postnatal mice, using the inducible Tie-2CreERT (DKO(IVE)) deleter. Impaired endothelial insulin/IGF-1 signaling did not have a significant impact on endothelial homeostasis in the skin, as judged by number of vessels, vessel basement membrane staining intensity and barrier function. In contrast, challenging the skin through wounding strongly reduced neo-angiogenesis in DKO(IVE) mice, accompanied by reduced granulation tissue formation reduced. These results show that endothelial insulin/IGF signaling is essential for neo-angiogenesis upon wounding, and imply that reduced endothelial insulin/IGF signaling directly contributes to diabetes-associated impaired healing.

%X Somatic stem cell (SSC) dysfunction is typical for different progeroid phenotypes in mice with genomic DNA repair defects. MtDNA mutagenesis in mice with defective Polg exonuclease activity also leads to progeroid symptoms, by an unknown mechanism. We found that Polg-Mutator mice had neural (NSC) and hematopoietic progenitor (HPC) dysfunction already from embryogenesis. NSC self-renewal was decreased in vitro, and quiescent NSC amounts were reduced in vivo. HPCs showed abnormal lineage differentiation leading to anemia and lymphopenia. N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment rescued both NSC and HPC abnormalities, suggesting that subtle ROS/redox changes, induced by mtDNA mutagenesis, modulate SSC function. Our results show that mtDNA mutagenesis affected SSC function early but manifested as respiratory chain deficiency in nondividing tissues in old age. Deletor mice, having mtDNA deletions in postmitotic cells and no progeria, had normal SSCs. We propose that SSC compartment is sensitive to mtDNA mutagenesis, and that mitochondrial dysfunction in SSCs can underlie progeroid manifestations.

%X Protein ubiquitylation has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism that impacts almost every aspect of the DNA damage response. In this review, we discuss how DNA repair and checkpoint pathways utilize the diversity offered by the ubiquitin conjugation system to modulate the response to genotoxic lesions in space and time. In particular, we will highlight recent work done on the regulation of DNA double-strand breaks signalling and repair by the RNF8/RNF168 E3 ubiquitin ligases, the Fanconi anemia pathway and the role of protein degradation in the enforcement and termination of checkpoint signalling. We also discuss the various functions of deubiquitylating enzymes in these processes along with potential avenues for exploiting the ubiquitin conjugation/deconjugation system for therapeutic purposes.

%X Studies of X chromosome evolution in various organisms have indicated that sex-biased genes are nonrandomly distributed between the X and autosomes. Here, to extend these studies to nematodes, we annotated and analyzed X chromosome gene content in four Caenorhabditis species and in Pristionchus pacificus. Our gene expression analyses comparing young adult male and female mRNA-seq data indicate that, in general, nematode X chromosomes are enriched for genes with high female-biased expression and depleted of genes with high male-biased expression. Genes with low sex-biased expression do not show the same trend of X chromosome enrichment and depletion. Combined with the observation that highly sex-biased genes are primarily expressed in the gonad, differential distribution of sex-biased genes reflects differences in evolutionary pressures linked to tissue-specific regulation of X chromosome transcription. Our data also indicate that X dosage imbalance between males (XO) and females (XX) is influential in shaping both expression and gene content of the X chromosome. Predicted upregulation of the single male X to match autosomal transcription (Ohno's hypothesis) is supported by our observation that overall transcript levels from the X and autosomes are similar for highly expressed genes. However, comparison of differentially located one-to-one orthologs between C. elegans and P. pacificus indicates lower expression of X-linked orthologs, arguing against X upregulation. These contradicting observations may be reconciled if X upregulation is not a global mechanism but instead acts locally on a subset of tissues and X-linked genes that are dosage sensitive.

%X FoxO transcription factors, inhibited by insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS), are crucial players in numerous organismal processes including lifespan. Using genomic tools, we uncover over 700 direct dFOXO targets in adult female Drosophila. dFOXO is directly required for transcription of several IIS components and interacting pathways, such as TOR, in the wild-type fly. The genomic locations occupied by dFOXO in adults are different from those observed in larvae or cultured cells. These locations remain unchanged upon activation by stresses or reduced IIS, but the binding is increased and additional targets activated upon genetic reduction in IIS. We identify the part of the IIS transcriptional response directly controlled by dFOXO and the indirect effects and show that parts of the transcriptional response to IIS reduction do not require dfoxo. Promoter analyses revealed GATA and other forkhead factors as candidate mediators of the indirect and dfoxo-independent effects. We demonstrate genome-wide evolutionary conservation of dFOXO targets between the fly and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, enriched for a second tier of regulators including the dHR96/daf-12 nuclear hormone receptor.

FoxOs regulate a number of other TFs, but how these TFs in turn might mediate the anti-ageing programmes orchestrated by FoxOs in vivo is unclear. Here, we identify an E-twenty six (ETS)-family transcriptional repressor, Anterior open (Aop), as regulated by the single Drosophila melanogaster FoxO (dFOXO) in the adult gut. AOP, the functional orthologue of the human Etv6/Tel protein, binds numerous genomic sites also occupied by dFOXO and counteracts the activity of an ETS activator, Pointed (Pnt), to prevent the lifespan-shortening effects of co-activation of dFOXO and PNT. This detrimental synergistic effect of dFOXO and PNT appears to stem from a mis-regulation of lipid metabolism. At the same time, AOP activity in another fly organ, the fat body, has further beneficial roles, regulating genes in common with dfoxo, such as the secreted, non-sensory, odorant binding protein (Obp99b), and robustly extending lifespan. Our study reveals a complex interplay between evolutionarily conserved ETS factors and dFOXO, the functional significance of which may extend well beyond animal lifespan.

%X RNA interference (RNAi) provides an important tool for gene function discovery. It has been widely exploited in Caenorhabditis elegans ageing research because it does not appear to have any non-specific effects on ageing-related traits in that model organism. We show here that ubiquitous, adult-onset activation of the RNAi machinery, achieved by expressing a double stranded RNA targeting GFP or lacZ for degradation, or by increasing expression of Dicer substantially reduces lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster. Induction of GFPRNAi construct also alters the response of lifespan to nutrition, exacerbating the lifespan-shortening effects of food containing a high quantity of yeast. Our study indicates that activation of the RNAi machinery may have sequence-independent side-effects on lifespan, and that caution needs to be exercised when employing ubiquitous RNAi in Drosophila ageing studies. However, we also show that RNAi restricted to certain tissues may not be detrimental to lifespan.

%X Reduction in nutrient intake without malnutrition can delay ageing and extend healthy life in diverse organisms from yeast to primates. This effect can be recapitulated by genetic or pharmacological dampening of the signal through nutrient signalling pathways, making them a promising target for intervention into human ageing and age-related diseases. Here we review the current knowledge of the interactions between nutrient signalling pathways and ageing, focusing on the findings emerged in the past few years.

%X Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans each carry a single representative of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors, dFOXO and DAF-16, respectively. Both are required for lifespan extension by reduced insulin/Igf signaling, and their activation in key tissues can extend lifespan. Aging of these tissues may limit lifespan. Alternatively, FoxOs may promote longevity cell nonautonomously by signaling to themselves (FoxO to FoxO) or other factors (FoxO to other) in distal tissues. Here, we show that activation of dFOXO and DAF-16 in the gut/fat body does not require dfoxo/daf-16 elsewhere to extend lifespan. Rather, in Drosophila, activation of dFOXO in the gut/fat body or in neuroendocrine cells acts on other organs to promote healthy aging by signaling to other, as-yet-unidentified factors. Whereas FoxO-to-FoxO signaling appears to be required for metabolic homeostasis, our results pinpoint FoxO-to-other signaling as an important mechanism through which localized FoxO activity ameliorates aging.

%X Mitochondrial presequences and other unstructured peptides are degraded inside mitochondria by presequence proteases (PrePs) identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPreP), humans (hPreP), and yeast (Cym1/Mop112). The presequences of A. thaliana and human PreP are predicted to consist of 85 and 29 amino acids, respectively, whereas the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cym1/Mop112 presequence contains only 7 residues. These differences may explain the reported targeting of homologous proteins to different mitochondrial subcompartments. Here we have investigated the targeting capacity of the PreP homologues' presequences. We have produced fusion constructs containing N-terminal portions of AtPreP(1-125), hPreP(1-69), and Cym1(1-40) coupled to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and studied their import into isolated plant, mammalian, and yeast mitochondria, followed by mitochondrial subfractionation. Whereas the AtPreP presequence has the capacity to target GFP into the mitochondrial matrix of all three species, the hPreP presequence only targets GFP to the matrix of mammalian and yeast mitochondria. The Cym1/Mop112 presequence has an overall much weaker targeting capacity and only ensures mitochondrial sorting in its host species yeast. Revisiting the submitochondrial localization of Cym1 revealed that endogenous Cym1/Mop112 is localized to the matrix space, as has been previously reported for the plant and human homologues. Moreover, complementation studies in yeast show that native AtPreP restores the growth phenotype of yeast cells lacking Cym1, demonstrating functional conservation.

%X Mutations in the AFG3L2 gene have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 and spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome in humans; however, the pathogenic mechanism is still unclear. AFG3L2 encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial m-AAA protease, previously implicated in quality control of misfolded inner mitochondrial membrane proteins and in regulatory functions via processing of specific substrates. Here, we used a conditional Afg3l2 mouse model that allows restricted deletion of the gene in Purkinje cells (PCs) to shed light on the pathogenic cascade in the neurons mainly affected in the human diseases. We demonstrate a cell-autonomous requirement of AFG3L2 for survival of PCs. Examination of PCs prior to neurodegeneration revealed fragmentation and altered distribution of mitochondria in the dendritic tree, indicating that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics is an early event in the pathogenic process. Moreover, PCs displayed features pointing to defects in mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits at early stages. To unravel the underlying mechanism, we examined a constitutive knockout of Afg3l2, which revealed a decreased rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis associated with impaired mitochondrial ribosome assembly. We therefore propose that defective mitochondrial protein synthesis, leading to early-onset fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, is a central causative factor in AFG3L2-related neurodegeneration.

%X Mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) affects many processes in health and disease. SPG7 assembles with AFG3L2 into the mAAA protease at the inner membrane of mitochondria, degrades damaged proteins, and regulates the synthesis of mitochondrial ribosomes. SPG7 is cleaved and activated by AFG3L2 upon assembly. A variant in SPG7 that replaces arginine 688 with glutamine (Q688) is associated with several phenotypes, including toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and (as reported here) coronary artery disease. We demonstrate that SPG7 processing is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of AFG3L2. Carriers of Q688 bypass this regulation and constitutively process and activate SPG7 mAAA protease. Cells expressing Q688 produce higher ATP levels and ROS, promoting cell proliferation. Our results thus reveal an unexpected link between the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the mitochondria mAAA protease affecting ROS production and several clinical phenotypes.

%X Somatic mutations of mtDNA are implicated in the aging process, but there is no universally accepted method for their accurate quantification. We have used ultra-deep sequencing to study genome-wide mtDNA mutation load in the liver of normally- and prematurely-aging mice. Mice that are homozygous for an allele expressing a proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (mtDNA mutator mice) have 10-times-higher point mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. In addition, the mtDNA mutator mice have increased levels of a truncated linear mtDNA molecule, resulting in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. In contrast, circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions occur at extremely low frequencies in mtDNA mutator mice and can therefore not drive the premature aging phenotype. Sequence analysis shows that the main proportion of the mutation load in heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice and their wildtype siblings is inherited from their heterozygous mothers consistent with germline transmission. We found no increase in levels of point mutations or deletions in wildtype C57Bl/6N mice with increasing age, thus questioning the causative role of these changes in aging. In addition, there was no increased frequency of transversion mutations with time in any of the studied genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as a major cause of mtDNA mutations. Our results from studies of mice thus indicate that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development and do not result from damage accumulation in adult life.

%X Mitochondrial proteostasis depends on a hierarchical system of tightly controlled quality surveillance mechanisms. Proteases within mitochondria take center stage in this network. They eliminate misfolded and damaged proteins and ensure the biogenesis and morphogenesis of mitochondria by processing or degrading short-lived regulatory proteins. Mitochondrial gene expression, the mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism and the fusion of mitochondrial membranes are under proteolytic control. Furthermore, in response to stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, proteolysis inhibits fusion and facilitates mitophagy and apoptosis. Defining these versatile activities of mitochondrial proteases will be pivotal for understanding the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders associated with defective mitochondria-associated proteolysis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondrial dynamics and physiology.

%X Mitochondrial fusion and structure depend on the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1, whose activity is regulated by proteolytic processing. Constitutive OPA1 cleavage by YME1L and OMA1 at two distinct sites leads to the accumulation of both long and short forms of OPA1 and maintains mitochondrial fusion. Stress-induced OPA1 processing by OMA1 converts OPA1 completely into short isoforms, inhibits fusion, and triggers mitochondrial fragmentation. Here, we have analyzed the function of different OPA1 forms in cells lacking YME1L, OMA1, or both. Unexpectedly, deletion of Oma1 restored mitochondrial tubulation, cristae morphogenesis, and apoptotic resistance in cells lacking YME1L. Long OPA1 forms were sufficient to mediate mitochondrial fusion in these cells. Expression of short OPA1 forms promoted mitochondrial fragmentation, which indicates that they are associated with fission. Consistently, GTPase-inactive, short OPA1 forms partially colocalize with ER-mitochondria contact sites and the mitochondrial fission machinery. Thus, OPA1 processing is dispensable for fusion but coordinates the dynamic behavior of mitochondria and is crucial for mitochondrial integrity and quality control.

%X The identification of target proteins for small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) is a critical step towards a detailed understanding of the cellular functions of SUMOs. Substrate protein identification for SUMOs is hampered by the low abundance of SUMO targets, the finding that only a small fraction of these target proteins is sumoylated, and the high activity of deconjugating enzymes. Quantitative proteomics is a powerful tool to overcome these challenges, because it allows discrimination between contaminating proteins in SUMO-enriched preparations and true target proteins. In this chapter, the methodological details of the application of stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for the identification of target proteins for SUMOs are described. In addition to steady state sumoylation, the sumoylated proteome undergoes dynamic rearrangements in response to a diverse array of stimuli. SILAC also allows the study of sumoylation dynamics in response to these stimuli.

%X AIMS: Heart disease is commonly associated with altered mitochondrial function and signs of oxidative stress. This study elucidates whether primary cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction causes changes in cardiomyocyte handling of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+). We used a mouse model with a tissue-specific ablation of the recently discovered mtDNA transcription regulator Mterf3 (Mterf3 KO). These mice display a cardiomyopathy with severe respiratory chain dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and shortened lifespan. ROS and Ca(2+) handling were measured using fluorescent indicators and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Mterf3 KO hearts displayed no signs of increased ROS production or oxidative stress. Surprisingly, Mterf3 KO cardiomyocytes showed enlarged Ca(2+) transient amplitudes, faster sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) reuptake, and increased SR Ca(2+) load, resembling increased adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, spontaneous releases of Ca(2+) were frequent in Mterf3 KO cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiography (measured with telemetry in freely moving mice) showed a terminal state in Mterf3 KO mice with gradually developing bradycardia and atrioventricular block. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Mterf3 KO leads to a cardiomyopathy without signs of oxidative stress but with increased cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) cycling and an arrhythmogenic phenotype. These findings highlight the complex interaction between mitochondrial function, cardiomyocyte contractility, and compensatory mechanisms, such as activation of adrenergic signaling.

%X Nuclear receptors (NRs) are transcription factors typically regulated by lipophilic hormones, which coordinate metazoan metabolism, development and homeostasis. C. elegans has undergone a remarkable expansion of the family, harboring 284 of these receptors in its genome. Approximately 20 of them have been analyzed genetically, most of which correspond to conserved homologs in other metazoans. These NRs variously affect broad life history traits such as sex determination, molting, developmental timing, diapause, and life span. They also impact neural development, axon outgrowth and neuronal identity. Finally, they influence lipid and xenobiotic metabolism. The study of C. elegans NRs holds great promise for dissecting nuclear receptor signaling pathways in vivo in the context of complex endocrine networks.

%X Pioneering work in model organisms reveals that the reproductive system is involved not only in propagation of the species but also regulates organismal metabolism and longevity. In C. elegans, prevention of germline stem cell proliferation results in a 60% extension of lifespan, termed gonadal longevity. Gonadal longevity relies on the transcriptional activities of steroid nuclear receptor DAF-12, the FOXO transcription factor homolog DAF-16, the FOXA transcription factor homolog PHA-4, and the HNF-4-like nuclear receptor NHR-80. These transcription factors work in an integrated transcriptional network to regulate fatty acid lipolysis, autophagy, stress resistance and other processes, which altogether enhance homeostasis and extend life. Because the reproductive system also regulates longevity in other species, studies in C. elegans may shed light on ancient mechanisms governing reproduction and survival.

%X Hormones play a critical role in driving major stage transitions and developmental timing events in many species. In the nematode C. elegans the steroid hormone receptor, DAF-12, works at the confluence of pathways regulating developmental timing, stage specification, and longevity. DAF-12 couples environmental and physiologic signals to life history regulation, and it is embedded in a rich architecture governing diverse processes. Here, we highlight the molecular insights, extraordinary circuitry, and signaling pathways governing life stage transitions in the worm and how they have yielded fundamental insights into steroid regulation of biological time.

%X Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that often respond to small molecule metabolites and fat-soluble compounds to regulate gene expression. They broadly govern development, reproduction, metabolism, and homeostasis in diverse metazoan species and their dysregulation is associated with numerous diseases. Work in C. elegans has shed light on the seminal role of nuclear receptors in life history regulation, stem cell progression, developmental timing, cell fate specification, nutrient sensing, metabolism, and longevity. Here we highlight recent advances on the best-studied nuclear receptors in the worm, and how they illuminate metazoan biology.

%X Mitofusins, conserved dynamin-related GTPases in the mitochondrial outer membrane, mediate the fusion of mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of the mitofusin Fzo1 is regulated by sequential ubiquitylation at conserved lysine residues and by the deubiquitylases Ubp2 and Ubp12. Ubp2 and Ubp12 recognize distinct ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that have opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion. Ubp2 removes ubiquitin chains that initiate proteolysis of Fzo1 and inhibit fusion. Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitin chains that stabilize Fzo1 and promote mitochondrial fusion. Self-assembly of dynamin-related GTPases is critical for their function. Ubp12 deubiquitylates Fzo1 only after oligomerization. Moreover, ubiquitylation at one monomer activates ubiquitin chain formation on another monomer. Thus, regulation of mitochondrial fusion involves ubiquitylation of mitofusin at distinct lysine residues, intermolecular crosstalk between mitofusin monomers, and two deubiquitylases that act as regulatory and quality control enzymes.

%X Dynamin-related GTPase proteins (DRPs) are main players in membrane remodelling. Conserved DRPs called mitofusins (Mfn1/Mfn2/Fzo1) mediate the fusion of mitochondrial outer membranes (OM). OM fusion depends on self-assembly and GTPase activity of mitofusins as well as on two other proteins, Ugo1 and Mdm30. Here, we define distinct steps of the OM fusion cycle using in vitro and in vivo approaches. We demonstrate that yeast Fzo1 assembles into homo-dimers, depending on Ugo1 and on GTP binding to Fzo1. Fzo1 homo-dimers further associate upon formation of mitochondrial contacts, allowing membrane tethering. Subsequent GTP hydrolysis is required for Fzo1 ubiquitylation by the F-box protein Mdm30. Finally, Mdm30-dependent degradation of Fzo1 completes Fzo1 function in OM fusion. Our results thus unravel functions of Ugo1 and Mdm30 at distinct steps during OM fusion and suggest that protein clearance confers a non-cycling mechanism to mitofusins, which is distinct from other cellular membrane fusion events.

%X The transcription factor NF-kappaB is a critical regulator of immune responses. To determine how NF-kappaB builds transcriptional control networks, we need to obtain a topographic map of the factor bound to the genome and correlate it with global gene expression. We used a ChIP cloning technique and identified novel NF-kappaB target genes in response to virus infection. We discovered that most of the NF-kappaB-bound genomic sites deviate from the consensus and are located away from conventional promoter regions. Remarkably, we identified a novel abundant NF-kappaB-binding site residing in specialized Alu-repetitive elements having the potential for long range transcription regulation, thus suggesting that in addition to its known role, NF-kappaB has a primate-specific function and a role in human evolution. By combining these data with global gene expression profiling of virus-infected cells, we found that most of the sites bound by NF-kappaB in the human genome do not correlate with changes in gene expression of the nearby genes and they do not appear to function in the context of synthetic promoters. These results demonstrate that repetitive elements interspersed in the human genome function as common target sites for transcription factors and may play an important role in expanding the repertoire of binding sites to engage new genes into regulatory networks.

%X Aging is a risk factor for several of the world's most prevalent diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease and metabolic disease. Although our understanding of the molecular pathways that contribute to the aging process and age-related disease is progressing through the use of model organisms, how to apply this knowledge in the clinic is less clear. In September, Nature Medicine, in collaboration with the Volkswagen Foundation, hosted a conference at the beautiful Herrenhausen Palace in Hannover, Germany with the goal of broadening our understanding of the aging process and its meaning as a 'risk factor' in disease. Here, several of the speakers at that conference answer questions posed by Nature Medicine.

%X A large number of mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLgammaA) cause human disease. The Y955C mutation is common and leads to a dominant disease with progressive external ophthalmoplegia and other symptoms. The biochemical effect of the Y955C mutation has been extensively studied and it has been reported to lower enzyme processivity due to decreased capacity to utilize dNTPs. However, it is unclear why this biochemical defect leads to a dominant disease. Consistent with previous reports, we show here that the POLgammaA:Y955C enzyme only synthesizes short DNA products at dNTP concentrations that are sufficient for proper function of wild-type POLgammaA. In addition, we find that this phenotype is overcome by increasing the dNTP concentration, e.g. dATP. At low dATP concentrations, the POLgammaA:Y955C enzyme stalls at dATP insertion sites and instead enters a polymerase/exonuclease idling mode. The POLgammaA:Y955C enzyme will compete with wild-type POLgammaA for primer utilization, and this will result in a heterogeneous population of short and long DNA replication products. In addition, there is a possibility that POLgammaA:Y955C is recruited to nicks of mtDNA and there enters an idling mode preventing ligation. Our results provide a novel explanation for the dominant mtDNA replication phenotypes seen in patients harboring the Y955C mutation, including the existence of site-specific stalling. Our data may also explain why mutations that disturb dATP pools can be especially deleterious for mtDNA synthesis.

%X Ring-shaped AAA+ ATPases control a variety of cellular processes by substrate unfolding and remodeling of macromolecular structures. However, how ATP hydrolysis within AAA+ rings is regulated and coupled to mechanical work is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate coordinated ATP hydrolysis within m-AAA protease ring complexes, conserved AAA+ machines in the inner membrane of mitochondria. ATP binding to one AAA subunit inhibits ATP hydrolysis by the neighboring subunit, leading to coordinated rather than stochastic ATP hydrolysis within the AAA ring. Unbiased genetic screens define an intersubunit signaling pathway involving conserved AAA motifs and reveal an intimate coupling of ATPase activities to central AAA pore loops. Coordinated ATP hydrolysis between adjacent subunits is required for membrane dislocation of substrates, but not for substrate processing. These findings provide insight into how AAA+ proteins convert energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work.

%X Genetic mutations that affect mitochondrial function often cause skeletal muscle dysfunction. Here, we used mice with skeletal-muscle-specific disruption of the nuclear gene for mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) to study whether changes in cellular Ca(2+) handling is part of the mechanism of muscle dysfunction in mitochondrial myopathy. Force measurements were combined with measurements of cytosolic Ca(2+), mitochondrial Ca(2+) and membrane potential and reactive oxygen species in intact, adult muscle fibres. The results show reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) storage capacity in Tfam KO muscles due to a decreased expression of calsequestrin-1. This resulted in decreased SR Ca(2+) release during contraction and hence lower force production in Tfam KO than in control muscles. Additionally, there were no signs of oxidative stress in Tfam KO cells, whereas they displayed increased mitochondrial [Ca(2+)] during repeated contractions. Mitochondrial [Ca(2+)] remained elevated long after the end of stimulation in muscle cells from terminally ill Tfam KO mice, and the increase was smaller in the presence of the cyclophilin D-binding inhibitor cyclosporin A. The mitochondrial membrane potential in Tfam KO cells did not decrease during repeated contractions. In conclusion, we suggest that the observed changes in Ca(2+) handling are adaptive responses with long-term detrimental effects. Reduced SR Ca(2+) release likely decreases ATP expenditure, but it also induces muscle weakness. Increased [Ca(2+)](mit) will stimulate mitochondrial metabolism acutely but may also trigger cell damage.

%X Members of the pentatricopeptide repeat domain (PPR) protein family bind RNA and are important for post-transcriptional control of organelle gene expression in unicellular eukaryotes, metazoans and plants. They also have a role in human pathology, as mutations in the leucine-rich PPR-containing (LRPPRC) gene cause severe neurodegeneration. We have previously shown that the mammalian LRPPRC protein and its Drosophila melanogaster homolog DmLRPPRC1 (also known as bicoid stability factor) are necessary for mitochondrial translation by controlling stability and polyadenylation of mRNAs. We here report characterization of DmLRPPRC2, a second fruit fly homolog of LRPPRC, and show that it has a predominant mitochondrial localization and interacts with a stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein (DmSLIRP2). Ubiquitous downregulation of DmLrpprc2 expression causes respiratory chain dysfunction, developmental delay and shortened lifespan. Unexpectedly, decreased DmLRPPRC2 expression does not globally affect steady-state levels or polyadenylation of mitochondrial transcripts. However, some mitochondrial transcripts abnormally associate with the mitochondrial ribosomes and some products are dramatically overproduced and other ones decreased, which, in turn, results in severe deficiency of respiratory chain complexes. The function of DmLRPPRC2 thus seems to be to ensure that mitochondrial transcripts are presented to the mitochondrial ribosomes in an orderly fashion to avoid poorly coordinated translation.

%X The dynamic network of mitochondria fragments under stress allowing the segregation of damaged mitochondria and, in case of persistent damage, their selective removal by mitophagy. Mitochondrial fragmentation upon depolarisation of mitochondria is brought about by the degradation of central components of the mitochondrial fusion machinery. The OMA1 peptidase mediates the degradation of long isoforms of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1 in the inner membrane. Here, we demonstrate that OMA1-mediated degradation of OPA1 is a general cellular stress response. OMA1 is constitutively active but displays strongly enhanced activity in response to various stress insults. We identify an amino terminal stress-sensor domain of OMA1, which is only present in homologues of higher eukaryotes and which modulates OMA1 proteolysis and activation. OMA1 activation is associated with its autocatalyic degradation, which initiates from both termini of OMA1 and results in complete OMA1 turnover. Autocatalytic proteolysis of OMA1 ensures the reversibility of the response and allows OPA1-mediated mitochondrial fusion to resume upon alleviation of stress. This differentiated stress response maintains the functional integrity of mitochondria and contributes to cell survival.

%X High output of steroid hormone synthesis in steroidogenic cells of the adrenal cortex and the gonads requires the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) that facilitates cholesterol mobilization to the mitochondrial inner membrane where the CYP11A1/P450scc enzyme complex converts the sterol to the first steroid. Earlier studies have shown that StAR is active while pausing on the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane while subsequent import of the protein into the matrix terminates the cholesterol mobilization activity. Consequently, during repeated activity cycles, high level of post-active StAR accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix. To prevent functional damage due to such protein overload effect, StAR is degraded by a sequence of three to four ATP-dependent proteases of the mitochondria protein quality control system, including LON and the m-AAA membranous proteases AFG3L2 and SPG7/paraplegin. Furthermore, StAR expression in both peri-ovulatory ovarian cells, or under ectopic expression in cell line models, results in up to 3-fold enrichment of the mitochondrial proteases and their transcripts. We named this novel form of mitochondrial stress as StAR overload response (SOR). To better understand the SOR mechanism at the transcriptional level we analyzed first the unexplored properties of the proximal promoter of the LON gene. Our findings suggest that the human nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2), also known as GA binding protein (GABP), is responsible for 88% of the proximal promoter activity, including the observed increase of transcription in the presence of StAR. Further studies are expected to reveal if common transcriptional determinants coordinate the SOR induced transcription of all the genes encoding the SOR proteases.

%X Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is essential for steroid hormone synthesis in the adrenal cortex and the gonads. StAR activity facilitates the supply of cholesterol substrate into the inner mitochondrial membranes where conversion of the sterol to a steroid is catalyzed. Mitochondrial import terminates the cholesterol mobilization activity of StAR and leads to mounting accumulation of StAR in the mitochondrial matrix. Our studies suggest that to prevent mitochondrial impairment, StAR proteolysis is executed by at least 2 mitochondrial proteases, ie, the matrix LON protease and the inner membrane complexes of the metalloproteases AFG3L2 and AFG3L2:SPG7/paraplegin. Gonadotropin administration to prepubertal rats stimulated ovarian follicular development associated with increased expression of the mitochondrial protein quality control system. In addition, enrichment of LON and AFG3L2 is evident in StAR-expressing ovarian cells examined by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, reporter studies of the protease promoters examined in the heterologous cell model suggest that StAR expression stimulates up to a 3.5-fold increase in the protease gene transcription. Such effects are StAR-specific, are independent of StAR activity, and failed to occur upon expression of StAR mutants that do not enter the matrix. Taken together, the results of this study suggest the presence of a novel regulatory loop, whereby acute accumulation of an apparent nuisance protein in the matrix provokes a mitochondria to nucleus signaling that, in turn, activates selected transcription of genes encoding the enrichment of mitochondrial proteases relevant for enhanced clearance of StAR.

%X Clonally expanded mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations resulting in focal respiratory chain deficiency in individual cells are proposed to contribute to the ageing of human tissues that depend on adult stem cells for self-renewal; however, the consequences of these mutations remain unclear. A good animal model is required to investigate this further; but it is unknown whether mechanisms for clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations, and the mutational spectra, are similar between species. Here we show that mice, heterozygous for a mutation disrupting the proof-reading activity of mtDNA polymerase (PolgA(+/mut)) resulting in an increased mtDNA mutation rate, accumulate clonally expanded mtDNA point mutations in their colonic crypts with age. This results in focal respiratory chain deficiency, and by 81 weeks of age these animals exhibit a similar level and pattern of respiratory chain deficiency to 70-year-old human subjects. Furthermore, like in humans, the mtDNA mutation spectrum appears random and there is an absence of selective constraints. Computer simulations show that a random genetic drift model of mtDNA clonal expansion can accurately model the data from the colonic crypts of wild-type, PolgA(+/mut) animals, and humans, providing evidence for a similar mechanism for clonal expansion of mtDNA point mutations between these mice and humans.

%X The intermembrane space of mitochondria contains a dedicated chaperone network-the small translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) family-for the sorting of hydrophobic precursors. All small TIMs are defined by the presence of a twin CX(3)C motif and the monomeric proteins are stabilized by two intramolecular disulfide bonds formed between the cysteines of these motifs. The conserved cysteine residues within small TIM members have also been shown to participate in early biogenesis events, with the most N-terminal cysteine residue important for import and retention within the intermembrane space via the receptor and disulfide oxidase, Mia40. In this study, we have analyzed the in vivo consequences of improper folding of small TIM chaperones by generating site-specific cysteine mutants and assessed the fate of the incompletely oxidized proteins within mitochondria. We show that no individual cysteine residue is required for the function of Tim9 or Tim10 in yeast and that defective assembly of the small TIMs induces their proteolytic clearance from mitochondria. We delineate a clearance mechanism for the mutant proteins and their unassembled wild-type partner protein by the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease, Yme1 (yeast mitochondrial escape 1).

Surveillance mechanisms acting at the molecular, organellar, and cellular level monitor mitochondrial integrity and ensure the maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis. Here we will review the central role of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases, the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome system, and the mitochondrial unfolded response in this interconnected quality control network, highlighting the dual function of some proteases in protein quality control within the organelle and for the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and mitophagy.

%X Sensory ataxic neuropathy (SAN) is a recently identified neurological disorder in golden retrievers. Pedigree analysis revealed that all affected dogs belong to one maternal lineage, and a statistical analysis showed that the disorder has a mitochondrial origin. A one base pair deletion in the mitochondrial tRNA(Tyr) gene was identified at position 5304 in affected dogs after re-sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome of seven individuals. The deletion was not found among dogs representing 18 different breeds or in six wolves, ruling out this as a common polymorphism. The mutation could be traced back to a common ancestor of all affected dogs that lived in the 1970s. We used a quantitative oligonucleotide ligation assay to establish the degree of heteroplasmy in blood and tissue samples from affected dogs and controls. Affected dogs and their first to fourth degree relatives had 0-11% wild-type (wt) sequence, while more distant relatives ranged between 5% and 60% wt sequence and all unrelated golden retrievers had 100% wt sequence. Northern blot analysis showed that tRNA(Tyr) had a 10-fold lower steady-state level in affected dogs compared with controls. Four out of five affected dogs showed decreases in mitochondrial ATP production rates and respiratory chain enzyme activities together with morphological alterations in muscle tissue, resembling the changes reported in human mitochondrial pathology. Altogether, these results provide conclusive evidence that the deletion in the mitochondrial tRNA(Tyr) gene is the causative mutation for SAN.

%X Tissue stem cells and germ line or embryonic stem cells were shown to have reduced oxidative metabolism, which was proposed to be an adaptive mechanism to reduce damage accumulation caused by reactive oxygen species. However, an alternate explanation is that stem cells are less dependent on specialized cytoplasmic functions compared with differentiated cells, therefore, having a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic volume ratio and consequently a low mitochondrial content. To determine whether stem cells rely or not on mitochondrial respiration, we selectively ablated the electron transport chain in the basal layer of the epidermis, which includes the epidermal progenitor/stem cells (EPSCs). This was achieved using a loxP-flanked mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) allele in conjunction with a keratin 14 Cre transgene. The epidermis of these animals (Tfam(EKO)) showed a profound depletion of mitochondrial DNA and complete absence of respiratory chain complexes. However, despite a short lifespan due to malnutrition, epidermal development and skin barrier function were not impaired. Differentiation of epidermal layers was normal and no proliferation defect or major increase of apoptosis could be observed. In contrast, mice with an epidermal ablation of prohibitin-2, a scaffold protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane, displayed a dramatic phenotype observable already in utero, with severely impaired skin architecture and barrier function, ultimately causing death from dehydration shortly after birth. In conclusion, we here provide unequivocal evidence that EPSCs, and probably tissue stem cells in general, are independent of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, but still require a functional dynamic mitochondrial compartment.

%X BACKGROUND: The development of multicellular organisms is accompanied by gene expression changes in differentiating cells. Profiling stage-specific expression during development may reveal important insights into gene sets that contributed to the morphological diversity across the animal kingdom. RESULTS: We sequenced RNA-seq libraries throughout a developmental timecourse of the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. The transcriptomes reflect early larval stages, adult worms including late larvae, and growth-arrested dauer larvae and allowed the identification of developmentally regulated gene clusters. Our data reveals similar trends as previous transcriptome profiling of dauer worms and represents the first expression data for early larvae in P. pacificus. Gene expression clusters characterizing early larval stages show most significant enrichments of chaperones, while collagens are most significantly enriched in transcriptomes of late larvae and adult worms. By combining expression data with phylogenetic analysis, we found that developmentally regulated genes are found in paralogous clusters that have arisen through lineage-specific duplications after the split from the Caenorhabditis elegans branch. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that gene duplications of developmentally regulated genes represent a plausible evolutionary mechanism to increase the dosage of stage-specific expression. Consequently, this may contribute to the substantial divergence in expression profiles that has been observed across larger evolutionary time scales.

%X In response to small-molecule signals such as retinoids or steroids, nuclear receptors activate gene expression to regulate development in different tissues. MicroRNAs turn off target gene expression within cells by binding complementary regions in messenger RNA transcripts, and they have been broadly implicated in development and disease. Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear receptor DAF-12 and its steroidal ligand directly activate promoters of let-7 microRNA family members to down-regulate the microRNA target hbl-1, which drives progression of epidermal stem cells from second to third larval stage patterns of cell division. Conversely, the receptor without the ligand represses microRNA expression during developmental arrest. These findings identify microRNAs as components of a hormone-coupled molecular switch that shuts off earlier developmental programs to allow for later ones.

%X Conventional ubiquitination involves the ATP-dependent formation of amide bonds between the ubiquitin C terminus and primary amines in substrate proteins. Recently, SdeA, an effector protein of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila, was shown to mediate NAD-dependent and ATP-independent ubiquitin transfer to host proteins. Here, we identify a phosphodiesterase domain in SdeA that efficiently catalyzes phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin on a specific arginine via an ADP-ribose-ubiquitin intermediate. SdeA also catalyzes a chemically and structurally distinct type of substrate ubiquitination by conjugating phosphoribosylated ubiquitin to serine residues of protein substrates via a phosphodiester bond. Furthermore, phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin prevents activation of E1 and E2 enzymes of the conventional ubiquitination cascade, thereby impairing numerous cellular processes including mitophagy, TNF signaling, and proteasomal degradation. We propose that phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin potently modulates ubiquitin functions in mammalian cells.

%X DNA polymerase eta is a Y family polymerase involved in translesion synthesis (TLS). Its action is initiated by simultaneous interaction between the PIP box in pol eta and PCNA and between the UBZ in pol eta and monoubiquitin attached to PCNA. Whereas monoubiquitination of PCNA is required for its interaction with pol eta during TLS, we now show that monoubiquitination of pol eta inhibits this interaction, preventing its functions in undamaged cells. Identification of monoubiquitination sites within pol eta nuclear localization signal (NLS) led to the discovery that pol eta NLS directly contacts PCNA, forming an extended pol eta-PCNA interaction surface. We name this the PCNA-interacting region (PIR) and show that its monoubiquitination is downregulated by various DNA-damaging agents. We propose that this mechanism ensures optimal availability of nonubiquitinated, TLS-competent pol eta after DNA damage. Our work shows how monoubiquitination can either positively or negatively regulate the assembly of a protein complex, depending on which substrates are targeted by ubiquitin.

%X Genetic down-regulation of a major nutrient-sensing pathway, TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling, can improve health and extend lifespan in evolutionarily distant organisms such as yeast and mammals. Recently, it has been demonstrated that treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of the TOR pathway, rapamycin, can replicate those findings and improve aging in a variety of model organisms. The proposed underlying anti-aging mechanisms are down-regulated translation, increased autophagy, altered metabolism and increased stress resistance.

%X The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is a major nutrient-sensing pathway that, when genetically downregulated, increases life span in evolutionarily diverse organisms including mammals. The central component of this pathway, TOR kinase, is the target of the inhibitory drug rapamycin, a highly specific and well-described drug approved for human use. We show here that feeding rapamycin to adult Drosophila produces the life span extension seen in some TOR mutants. Increase in life span by rapamycin was associated with increased resistance to both starvation and paraquat. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that rapamycin increased longevity specifically through the TORC1 branch of the TOR pathway, through alterations to both autophagy and translation. Rapamycin could increase life span of weak insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) pathway mutants and of flies with life span maximized by dietary restriction, indicating additional mechanisms.

%X The expression of almost all genes in animals is subject to post-transcriptional regulation by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). The interactions between both RBPs and miRNAs with mRNA can be mapped on a whole-transcriptome level using experimental and computational techniques established in the past years. The combined action of RBPs and miRNAs is thought to form a post-transcriptional regulatory code. Here we present doRiNA 2.0, available at http://dorina.mdc-berlin.de. In this highly improved new version, we have completely reworked the user interface and expanded the database to improve the usability of the website. Taking into account user feedback over the past years, the input forms for both the simple and the combinatorial search function have been streamlined and combined into a single web page that will also display the search results. Especially, custom uploads is one of the key new features in doRiNA 2.0. To enable the inclusion of doRiNA into third-party analysis pipelines, all operations are accessible via a REST API. Alternatively, local installations can be queried using a Python API. Both the web application and the APIs are available under an OSI-approved Open Source license that allows research and commercial access and re-use.

%X Defective signaling or repair of DNA double-strand breaks has been associated with developmental defects and human diseases. The E3 ligase RING finger 168 (RNF168), mutated in the human radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, dysmorphic features, and learning difficulties syndrome, was shown to ubiquitylate H2A-type histones, and this ubiquitylation was proposed to facilitate the recruitment of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks. In contrast to more upstream proteins signaling DNA double-strand breaks (e.g., RNF8), deficiency of RNF168 fully prevents both the initial recruitment to and retention of 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage; however, the mechanism for this difference has remained unclear. Here, we identify mechanisms that regulate 53BP1 recruitment to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks and provide evidence that RNF168 plays a central role in the regulation of 53BP1 functions. RNF168 mediates K63-linked ubiquitylation of 53BP1 which is required for the initial recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA double-strand breaks and for its function in DNA damage repair, checkpoint activation, and genomic integrity. Our findings highlight the multistep roles of RNF168 in signaling DNA damage.

%X Eukaryotic cells have evolved to use complex pathways for DNA damage signaling and repair to maintain genomic integrity. RNF168 is a novel E3 ligase that functions downstream of ATM,gamma-H2A.X, MDC1, and RNF8. It has been shown to ubiquitylate histone H2A and to facilitate the recruitment of other DNA damage response proteins, including 53BP1, to sites of DNA break. In addition, RNF168 mutations have been causally linked to the human RIDDLE syndrome. In this study, we report that Rnf168(-/-) mice are immunodeficient and exhibit increased radiosensitivity. Rnf168(-/-) males suffer from impaired spermatogenesis in an age-dependent manner. Interestingly, in contrast to H2a.x(-/-), Mdc1(-/-), and Rnf8(-/-) cells, transient recruitment of 53bp1 to DNA double-strand breaks was abolished in Rnf168(-/-) cells. Remarkably, similar to 53bp1 inactivation, but different from H2a.x deficiency, inactivation of Rnf168 impairs long-range V(D)J recombination in thymocytes and results in long insertions at the class-switch junctions of B-cells. Loss of Rnf168 increases genomic instability and synergizes with p53 inactivation in promoting tumorigenesis. Our data reveal the important physiological functions of Rnf168 and support its role in both gamma-H2a.x-Mdc1-Rnf8-dependent and -independent signaling pathways of DNA double-strand breaks. These results highlight a central role for RNF168 in the hierarchical network of DNA break signaling that maintains genomic integrity and suppresses cancer development in mammals.

%X An autosomal recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (AR-HSP) is primarily caused by mutations in the SPG7 gene, which codes for paraplegin, a subunit of the hetero-oligomeric m-AAA protease in mitochondria. In the current study, sequencing of the SPG7 gene in the genomic DNA of 25 unrelated HSP individuals/families led to the identification of two HSP patients with compound heterozygous mutations (p.G349S/p.W583C and p.A510V/p.N739KfsX741) in the coding sequence of the SPG7 gene. We used a yeast complementation assay to evaluate the functional consequence of novel SPG7 sequence variants detected in the HSP patients. We assessed the proteolytic activity of hetero-oligomeric m-AAA proteases composed of paraplegin variant(s) and proteolytically inactive forms of AFG3L2 (AFG3L2(E575Q) or AFG3L2(K354A)) upon expression in m-AAA protease-deficient yeast cells. We demonstrate that the newly identified paraplegin variants perturb the proteolytic function of hetero-oligomeric m-AAA protease. Moreover, commonly occurring silent polymorphisms such as p.T503A and p.R688Q could be distinguished from mutations (p.G349S, p.W583C, p.A510V, and p.N739KfsX741) in our HSP cohort. The yeast complementation assay thus can serve as a reliable system to distinguish a pathogenic mutation from a silent polymorphism for any novel SPG7 sequence variant, which will facilitate the interpretation of genetic data for SPG7.

%X m-AAA proteases exert dual functions in the mitochondrial inner membrane: they mediate the processing of specific regulatory proteins and ensure protein quality control degrading misfolded polypeptides to peptides. Loss of these activities leads to neuronal cell death in several neurodegenerative disorders. However, it is unclear how the m-AAA protease chooses between specific processing and complete degradation. A central and conserved function of the m-AAA protease is the processing of the ribosomal subunit MrpL32, which regulates ribosome biogenesis and the formation of respiratory complexes. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of a tightly folded domain harbouring a conserved CxxC-X(9)-CxxC sequence motif halts degradation initiated from the N-terminus and triggers the release of mature MrpL32. Oxidative stress impairs folding of MrpL32, resulting in its degradation by the m-AAA protease and decreased mitochondrial translation. Surprisingly, MrpL32 folding depends on its mitochondrial targeting sequence. Presequence-assisted folding of MrpL32 requires the complete import of the MrpL32 precursor before maturation occurs and therefore explains the need for post-translocational processing by the m-AAA protease rather than co-translocational cleavage by the general mitochondrial processing peptidase.

Here, we show that increasing residual p53 helicity results in stronger Mdm2 binding, altered p53 dynamics, impaired target gene expression and failure to induce cell cycle arrest upon DNA damage. These results establish that residual structure is an important determinant of signaling fidelity in cells.

%X Growing evidence suggests a key role for RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in genome stability programs. Additionally, recent developments in RNA sequencing technologies, as well as mass-spectrometry techniques, have greatly expanded our knowledge on protein-RNA interactions. We here use full transcriptome sequencing and label-free LC/MS/MS to identify global changes in protein-RNA interactions in response to etoposide-induced genotoxic stress. We show that RBPs have distinct binding patterns in response to genotoxic stress and that inactivation of the RBP regulator module, p38/MK2, can affect the entire spectrum of protein-RNA interactions that take place in response to stress. In addition to validating the role of known RBPs like Srsf1, Srsf2, Elavl1 in the genotoxic stress response, we add a new collection of RBPs to the DNA damage response. We identify Khsrp as a highly regulated RBP in response to genotoxic stress and further validate its role as a driver of the G(1/)S transition through the suppression of Cdkn1a(P21) transcripts. Finally, we identify KHSRP as an indicator of overall survival, as well as disease free survival in glioblastoma multiforme.

%X Polyadenylation has well characterised roles in RNA turnover and translation in a variety of biological systems. While polyadenylation on mitochondrial transcripts has been suggested to be a two-step process required to complete translational stop codons, its involvement in mitochondrial RNA turnover is less well understood. We studied knockdown and knockout models of the mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (MTPAP) in Drosophila melanogaster and demonstrate that polyadenylation of mitochondrial mRNAs is exclusively performed by MTPAP. Further, our results show that mitochondrial polyadenylation does not regulate mRNA stability but protects the 3&apos; terminal integrity, and that despite a lack of functioning 3&apos; ends, these trimmed transcripts are translated, suggesting that polyadenylation is not required for mitochondrial translation. Additionally, loss of MTPAP leads to reduced steady-state levels and disturbed maturation of tRNACys, indicating that polyadenylation in mitochondria might be important for the stability and maturation of specific tRNAs.

%X Replication errors are the main cause of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and a compelling approach to decrease mutation levels would therefore be to increase the fidelity of the catalytic subunit (POLgammaA) of the mtDNA polymerase. Here we genomically engineer the tamas locus, encoding fly POLgammaA, and introduce alleles expressing exonuclease- (exo(-)) and polymerase-deficient (pol(-)) POLgammaA versions. The exo(-) mutant leads to accumulation of point mutations and linear deletions of mtDNA, whereas pol(-) mutants cause mtDNA depletion. The mutant tamas alleles are developmentally lethal but can complement each other in trans resulting in viable flies with clonally expanded mtDNA mutations. Reconstitution of human mtDNA replication in vitro confirms that replication is a highly dynamic process where POLgammaA goes on and off the template to allow complementation during proofreading and elongation. The created fly models are valuable tools to study germ line transmission of mtDNA and the pathophysiology of POLgammaA mutation disease.

%X Over the last decade, accumulating evidence has suggested a causative link between mitochondrial dysfunction and major phenotypes associated with aging. Somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and respiratory chain dysfunction accompany normal aging, but the first direct experimental evidence that increased mtDNA mutation levels contribute to progeroid phenotypes came from the mtDNA mutator mouse. Recent evidence suggests that increases in aging-associated mtDNA mutations are not caused by damage accumulation, but rather are due to clonal expansion of mtDNA replication errors that occur during development. Here we discuss the caveats of the traditional mitochondrial free radical theory of aging and highlight other possible mechanisms, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and the target of rapamycin pathways, that underlie the central role of mitochondria in the aging process.

%X The bicoid stability factor (BSF) of Drosophila melanogaster has been reported to be present in the cytoplasm, where it stabilizes the maternally contributed bicoid mRNA and binds mRNAs expressed from early zygotic genes. BSF may also have other roles, as it is ubiquitously expressed and essential for survival of adult flies. We have performed immunofluorescence and cell fractionation analyses and show here that BSF is mainly a mitochondrial protein. We studied two independent RNAi knockdown fly lines and report that reduced BSF protein levels lead to a severe respiratory deficiency and delayed development at the late larvae stage. Ubiquitous knockdown of BSF results in a severe reduction of the polyadenylation tail lengths of specific mitochondrial mRNAs, accompanied by an enrichment of unprocessed polycistronic RNA intermediates. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction in mRNA steady state levels, despite increased de novo transcription. Surprisingly, mitochondrial de novo translation is increased and abnormal mitochondrial translation products are present in knockdown flies, suggesting that BSF also has a role in coordinating the mitochondrial translation in addition to its role in mRNA maturation and stability. We thus report a novel function of BSF in flies and demonstrate that it has an important intra-mitochondrial role, which is essential for maintaining mtDNA gene expression and oxidative phosphorylation.

%X A number of studies showed that the development and the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans is dependent on mitochondrial function. In this study, we addressed the role of mitochondrial DNA levels and mtDNA maintenance in development of C. elegans by analyzing deletion mutants for mitochondrial polymerase gamma (polg-1(ok1548)). Surprisingly, even though previous studies in other model organisms showed necessity of polymerase gamma for embryonic development, homozygous polg-1(ok1548) mutants had normal development and reached adulthood without any morphological defects. However, polg-1 deficient animals have a seriously compromised gonadal function as a result of severe mitochondrial depletion, leading to sterility and shortened lifespan. Our results indicate that the gonad is the primary site of mtDNA replication, whilst the mtDNA of adult somatic tissues mainly stems from the developing embryo. Furthermore, we show that the mtDNA copy number shows great plasticity as it can be almost tripled as a response to the environmental stimuli. Finally, we show that the mtDNA copy number is an essential limiting factor for the worm development and therefore, a number of mechanisms set to maintain mtDNA levels exist, ensuring a normal development of C. elegans even in the absence of the mitochondrial replicase.

%X The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) can undergo self-modification to form polymeric chains that have been implicated in cellular processes such as meiosis, genome maintenance and stress response. Investigations into the biological role of polymeric chains have been hampered by the absence of a protocol for the purification of proteins linked to SUMO chains. In this paper, we describe a rapid affinity purification procedure for the isolation of endogenous polySUMO-modified species that generates highly purified material suitable for individual protein studies and proteomic analysis. We use this approach to identify more than 300 putative polySUMO conjugates from cultured eukaryotic cells.

%X Skeletal muscle often shows a delayed force recovery after fatiguing stimulation, especially at low stimulation frequencies. In this study we focus on the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this fatigue-induced prolonged low-frequency force depression. Intact, single muscle fibres were dissected from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles of rats and wild-type and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) overexpressing mice. Force and myoplasmic free [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](i)) were measured. Fibres were stimulated at different frequencies before and 30 min after fatigue induced by repeated tetani. The results show a marked force decrease at low stimulation frequencies 30 min after fatiguing stimulation in all fibres. This decrease was associated with reduced tetanic [Ca(2+)](i) in wild-type mouse fibres, whereas rat fibres and mouse SOD2 overexpressing fibres instead displayed a decreased myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity. The SOD activity was approximately 50% lower in wild-type mouse than in rat FDB muscles. Myoplasmic ROS increased during repeated tetanic stimulation in rat fibres but not in wild-type mouse fibres. The decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity in rat fibres could be partially reversed by application of the reducing agent dithiothreitol, whereas the decrease in tetanic [Ca(2+)](i) in wild-type mouse fibres was not affected by dithiothreitol or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion, we describe two different causes of fatigue-induced prolonged low-frequency force depression, which correlate to differences in SOD activity and ROS metabolism. These findings may have clinical implications since ROS-mediated impairments in myofibrillar function can be counteracted by reductants and antioxidants, whereas changes in SR Ca(2+) handling appear more resistant to interventions.

%X Overexpression of sirtuins (NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Studies of the effects of genes on ageing are vulnerable to confounding effects of genetic background. Here we re-examined the reported effects of sirtuin overexpression on ageing and found that standardization of genetic background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent effects in both C. elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, outcrossing of a line with high-level sir-2.1 overexpression abrogated the longevity increase, but did not abrogate sir-2.1 overexpression. Instead, longevity co-segregated with a second-site mutation affecting sensory neurons. Outcrossing of a line with low-copy-number sir-2.1 overexpression also abrogated longevity. A Drosophila strain with ubiquitous overexpression of dSir2 using the UAS-GAL4 system was long-lived relative to wild-type controls, as previously reported, but was not long-lived relative to the appropriate transgenic controls, and nor was a new line with stronger overexpression of dSir2. These findings underscore the importance of controlling for genetic background and for the mutagenic effects of transgene insertions in studies of genetic effects on lifespan. The life-extending effect of dietary restriction on ageing in Drosophila has also been reported to be dSir2 dependent. We found that dietary restriction increased fly lifespan independently of dSir2. Our findings do not rule out a role for sirtuins in determination of metazoan lifespan, but they do cast doubt on the robustness of the previously reported effects of sirtuins on lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila.

%X The involvement of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established. However, it is becoming clear that the amyloid load in AD brains consists of a heterogeneous mixture of Abeta peptides, implying that a thorough understanding of their respective role and toxicity is crucial for the development of efficient treatments. Besides the well-studied Abeta40 and Abeta42 species, recent data have raised the possibility that Abeta43 peptides might be instrumental in AD pathogenesis, because they are frequently observed in both dense and diffuse amyloid plaques from human AD brains and are highly amyloidogenic in vitro. However, whether Abeta43 is toxic in vivo is currently unclear. Using Drosophila transgenic models of amyloid pathology, we show that Abeta43 peptides are mainly insoluble and highly toxic in vivo, leading to the progressive loss of photoreceptor neurons, altered locomotion and decreased lifespan when expressed in the adult fly nervous system. In addition, we demonstrate that Abeta43 species are able to trigger the aggregation of the typically soluble and non-toxic Abeta40, leading to synergistic toxic effects on fly lifespan and climbing ability, further suggesting that Abeta43 peptides could act as a nucleating factor in AD brains. Altogether, our study demonstrates high pathogenicity of Abeta43 species in vivo and supports the idea that Abeta43 contributes to the pathological events leading to neurodegeneration in AD.

%X Precise control of mitochondrial DNA gene expression is critical for regulation of oxidative phosphorylation capacity in mammals. The MTERF protein family plays a key role in this process, and its members have been implicated in regulation of transcription initiation and site-specific transcription termination. We now demonstrate that a member of this family, MTERF4, directly controls mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis and translation. MTERF4 forms a stoichiometric complex with the ribosomal RNA methyltransferase NSUN4 and is necessary for recruitment of this factor to the large ribosomal subunit. Loss of MTERF4 leads to defective ribosomal assembly and a drastic reduction in translation. Our results thus show that MTERF4 is an important regulator of translation in mammalian mitochondria.

%X African annual fishes from the genus Nothobranchius are small teleosts that inhabit temporary water bodies subject to annual desiccation due to the alternation of the monsoon seasons. Given their unique biology, these fish have emerged as a model taxon in several biological disciplines. Their increasing popularity stems from the extremely short lifespan that is the result of their specific life-history adaptations and is retained under laboratory conditions. Nothobranchius furzeri, the most popular laboratory species, is the vertebrate species with the shortest lifespan recorded in captivity. In the laboratory, adults of different Nothobranchius species and populations live between 3 and 18 months and, notably, there is a negative correlation between the captive lifespan of a species and the aridity of their habitat. Their short lifespan is coupled to rapid age-dependent functional decline and expression of cellular and molecular changes comparable to those observed in other vertebrates, including humans. The recent development of transgenesis in this species makes it possible to insert specific constructs into their genome, and the establishment of transgenic lines is facilitated by their very rapid generation time, which can be as short as 1 month. This makes Nothobranchius species particularly suited for investigating biological and molecular aspects of ageing and ageing-associated dysfunctions. At the same time, they also represent a unique model taxon to investigate the evolution of life-history adaptations and their genetic architecture. We review their natural history, including phylogenetic relationships, distribution in relation to habitat conditions and natural selection for differential longevity, population structure and demography, and life cycle with emphasis on diapause that may occur at three stages during embryonic development. We further critically evaluate their use as a laboratory model for understanding the evolution of a rapid ageing rate and its consequences for other life-history traits, for cellular, molecular and integrative traits associated with the ageing process, high incidence of neoplasias, their utility for genome-wide gene-expression studies, and as a model for quantitative genetics. We summarize recent achievements in fostering Nothobranchius species as a widely applicable model system, including an annotated transcriptome, successful transgenesis, and existence of viable inbred lines. We compare the conditions they experience in the wild and in captivity and suggest that they are an ideal taxon to investigate natural genetic variation in a laboratory setting. We conclude that Nothobranchius species - and N. furzeri in particular - could become a unique model taxon that bridges interests in ecological and biomedical research. We hope that a conceptual and methodological integration of these two branches of biology will provide important new insights.

%X Understanding how complex tissues are formed, maintained, and regenerated through local growth, differentiation, and remodeling requires knowledge on how single-cell behaviors are coordinated on the population level. The self-renewing hair follicle, maintained by a distinct stem cell population, represents an excellent paradigm to address this question. A major obstacle in mechanistic understanding of hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) regulation has been the lack of a culture system that recapitulates HFSC behavior while allowing their precise monitoring and manipulation. Here, we establish an in vitro culture system based on a 3D extracellular matrix environment and defined soluble factors, which for the first time allows expansion and long-term maintenance of murine multipotent HFSCs in the absence of heterologous cell types. Strikingly, this scheme promotes de novo generation of HFSCs from non-HFSCs and vice versa in a dynamic self-organizing process. This bidirectional interconversion of HFSCs and their progeny drives the system into a population equilibrium state. Our study uncovers regulatory dynamics by which phenotypic plasticity of cells drives population-level homeostasis within a niche, and provides a discovery tool for studies on adult stem cell fate.

%X AAUAAA is the most highly conserved motif in eukaryotic mRNA polyadenylation sites and, in mammals, is specifically recognized by the multisubunit CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) complex. Despite its critical functions in mRNA 3' end formation, the molecular basis for CPSF-AAUAAA interaction remains poorly defined. The CPSF subunit CPSF160 has been implicated in AAUAAA recognition, but direct evidence has been lacking. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we unexpectedly found that CPSF subunits CPSF30 and Wdr33 directly contact AAUAAA. Importantly, the CPSF30-RNA interaction is essential for mRNA 3' processing and is primarily mediated by its zinc fingers 2 and 3, which are specifically targeted by the influenza protein NS1A to suppress host mRNA 3' processing. Our data suggest that AAUAAA recognition in mammalian mRNA 3' processing is more complex than previously thought and involves multiple protein-RNA interactions.

%X Extensive oncologic experience argues that the most efficacious applications of antiangiogenic agents rely upon a combination with cytotoxic drugs. Yet there remains a lack of clarity about how to optimize scheduling for such drug combinations. Prudent antiangiogenic therapy might transiently normalize blood vessels to improve tumor oxygenation and drug exposure. Using [(15)O]H2O positron emission tomography imaging in a preclinical mouse model of non-small cell lung cancer, we observed that short-term treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor/platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor PTK787 licensed a transient window of improved tumor blood flow. The improvement observed was associated with a reduced leakiness from tumor vessels, consistent with induction of a vascular normalization process. Initiation of a cytotoxic treatment in this window of tumor vessel normalization resulted in increased efficacy, as illustrated by improved outcomes of erlotinib administration after initial PTK787 treatment. Notably, intermittent PTK787 treatment also facilitated long-term tumor regression. In summary, our findings offer strong evidence that short-term antiangiogenic therapy can promote a transient vessel normalization process that improves the delivery and efficacy of a targeted cytotoxic drug.

%X Nematodes and insects are the two most speciose animal phyla and nematode-insect associations encompass widespread biological interactions. To dissect the chemical signals and the genes mediating this association, we investigated the effect of an oriental beetle sex pheromone on the development and behavior of the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. We found that while the beetle pheromone is attractive to P. pacificus adults, the pheromone arrests embryo development, paralyzes J2 larva, and inhibits exit of dauer larvae. To uncover the mechanism that regulates insect pheromone sensitivity, a newly identified mutant, Ppa-obi-1, is used to reveal the molecular links between altered attraction towards the beetle pheromone, as well as hypersensitivity to its paralyzing effects. Ppa-obi-1 encodes lipid-binding domains and reaches its highest expression in various cell types, including the amphid neuron sheath and excretory cells. Our data suggest that the beetle host pheromone may be a species-specific volatile synomone that co-evolved with necromeny.

%X Centrosomes organize microtubule (MT) arrays and are comprised of centrioles surrounded by ordered pericentriolar proteins. Centrioles are barrel-shaped structures composed of MTs, and as basal bodies they template the formation of cilia/flagella. Defects in centriole assembly can lead to ciliopathies and genome instability. The assembly of procentrioles requires a set of conserved proteins. It is initiated at the G1-to-S transition by PLK4 and CEP152, which help recruit SASS6 and STIL to the vicinity of the mother centriole to organize the cartwheel. Subsequently, CPAP promotes centriolar MT assembly and elongation in G2. While centriole integrity is maintained by CEP135 and POC1 through MT stabilization, centriole elongation requires POC5 and is restricted by CP110 and CEP97. How strict control of centriole length is achieved remains unclear. Here, we show that CEP120 and SPICE1 are required to localize CEP135 (but not SASS6, STIL, or CPAP) to procentrioles. CEP120 associates with SPICE1 and CPAP, and depletion of any of these proteins results in short procentrioles. Furthermore, CEP120 or CPAP overexpression results in excessive centriole elongation, a process dependent on CEP120, SPICE1, and CPAP. Our findings identify a shared function for these proteins in centriole length control.

%X Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose function depends on intramitochondrial phospholipid synthesis and the supply of membrane lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum. How phospholipids are transported to and in-between mitochondrial membranes remained unclear. We identified Ups1, a yeast member of a conserved family of intermembrane space proteins, as a lipid transfer protein that can shuttle phosphatidic acid between mitochondrial membranes. Lipid transfer required the dynamic assembly of Ups1 with Mdm35 and allowed conversion of phosphatidic acid to cardiolipin in the inner membrane. High cardiolipin concentrations prevented membrane dissociation of Ups1, leading to its proteolysis and inhibiting transport of phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin synthesis. Thus, intramitochondrial lipid trafficking may involve a regulatory feedback mechanism that limits the accumulation of cardiolipin in mitochondria.

%X Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions are a primary cause of mitochondrial disease and are believed to contribute to the aging process and to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite strong observational and experimental evidence, the molecular basis of the deletion process remains obscure. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the primary cause of mtDNA vulnerability to breakage resides in the formation of non-B DNA conformations, namely hairpin, cruciform and cloverleaf-like elements. Using the largest database of human mtDNA deletions built thus far (753 different cases), we show that site-specific breakage hotspots exist in the mtDNA. Furthermore, we discover that the most frequent deletion breakpoints occur within or near predicted structures, a result that is supported by data from transgenic mice with mitochondrial disease. There is also a significant association between the folding energy of an mtDNA region and the number of breakpoints that it harbours. In particular, two clusters of hairpins (near the D-loop 3'-terminus and the L-strand origin of replication) are hotspots for mtDNA breakage. Consistent with our hypothesis, the highest number of 5'- and 3'-breakpoints per base is found in the highly structured tRNA genes. Overall, the data presented in this study suggest that non-B DNA conformations are a key element of the mtDNA deletion process.

%X Sea urchin mtDNA is transcribed via a different mechanism compared to vertebrates. To gain information on the apparatus of sea urchin mitochondrial transcription we have characterized the DNA binding properties of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). The protein contains two HMG box domains but, differently from vertebrates, displays a very short C-terminal tail. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the distribution of tail length is mixed in the different lineages, indicating that it is a trait that undergoes rapid changes during evolution. Homology modeling suggests that the protein adopts the same configuration of the human counterpart and possibly a similar mode of binding to DNA. DNase I footprinting showed that TFAM specifically contacts mtDNA at a fixed distance from three AT-rich consensus sequences that were supposed to act as transcriptional initiation sites. Bound sequences are homologous and contain an inverted repeat motif, which resembles that involved in the intercalation of human TFAM in LSP DNA. The here reported data indicate that sea urchin TFAM specifically binds mtDNA. The protein could intercalate residues at the DNA inverted motif and, despite its short tail, might have a role in mitochondrial transcription.

%X TOR complex 1 (TORC1) is a potent anabolic regulator of cellular growth and metabolism. When cells have sufficient amino acids, TORC1 is active due to its lysosomal localization mediated via the Rag GTPases. Upon amino acid removal, the Rag GTPases release TORC1, causing it to become cytoplasmic and inactive. We show here that, upon amino acid removal, the Rag GTPases also recruit TSC2 to the lysosome, where it can act on Rheb. Only when both the Rag GTPases and Rheb are inactive is TORC1 fully released from the lysosome. Upon amino acid withdrawal, cells lacking TSC2 fail to completely release TORC1 from the lysosome, fail to completely inactivate TORC1, and fail to adjust physiologically to amino acid starvation. These data suggest that regulation of TSC2 subcellular localization may be a general mechanism to control its activity and place TSC2 in the amino-acid-sensing pathway to TORC1.

%X A bioinformatic analysis identified two putative NF-kappaB binding sites in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) promoter. The ability of p65RelA to interact with the LMP1 promoter was shown by in vitro and in vivo assays. Using an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line as a reporter system for the activity of the +40/-328 LMP1 promoter region, the functional importance of NF-kappaB and other transcription factor binding sites was demonstrated. p65RelA could also induce LMP1 expression from the EBV genome in Daudi and P3HR1 Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Finally, it was shown that p65RelA could cooperate with EBNA2 or the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the transactivation of the LMP1 promoter. Our study established the importance of NF-kappaB and several cis-acting elements in the regulation of the LMP1 promoter in a latency III environment and highlighted a complex interplay between NF-kappaB and other transcription factors in this process.

%X Aminosugars produced in the hexosamine pathway (HP) are utilized in protein glycosylation reactions involved in protein maturation and cellular signaling. Recent evidence revealed a role of the HP in protein quality control and ageing. Elevation of the HP product UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans results in resistance towards toxic aggregation-prone proteins, and extended lifespan. Glutamine-fructose 6 phosphate aminotransferase (GFAT-1), the HP's key enzyme, is a target of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Thus, cardiac stress in mice results in GFAT-1 activation that triggers a cytoprotective response. Feeding of glucosamine to aged mice increases their life expectancy. Here we discuss HP activation and cellular protein quality control mechanisms that result in stress resistance and suppression of age-related proteotoxicity.

%X Aging entails a progressive decline in protein homeostasis, which often leads to age-related diseases. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of protein synthesis and maturation for secreted and membrane proteins. Correct folding of ER proteins requires covalent attachment of N-linked glycan oligosaccharides. Here, we report that increased synthesis of N-glycan precursors in the hexosamine pathway improves ER protein homeostasis and extends lifespan in C. elegans. Addition of the N-glycan precursor N-acetylglucosamine to the growth medium slows aging in wild-type animals and alleviates pathology of distinct neurotoxic disease models. Our data suggest that reduced aggregation of metastable proteins and lifespan extension depend on enhanced ER-associated protein degradation, proteasomal activity, and autophagy. Evidently, hexosamine pathway activation or N-acetylglucosamine supplementation induces distinct protein quality control mechanisms, which may allow therapeutic intervention against age-related and proteotoxic diseases.

%X Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are genetically heterogeneous neurological disorders characterized by cerebellar dysfunction mostly due to Purkinje cell degeneration. Here we show that AFG3L2 mutations cause SCA type 28. Along with paraplegin, which causes recessive spastic paraplegia, AFG3L2 is a component of the conserved m-AAA metalloprotease complex involved in the maintenance of the mitochondrial proteome. We identified heterozygous missense mutations in five unrelated SCA families and found that AFG3L2 is highly and selectively expressed in human cerebellar Purkinje cells. m-AAA-deficient yeast cells expressing human mutated AFG3L2 homocomplex show respiratory deficiency, proteolytic impairment and deficiency of respiratory chain complex IV. Structure homology modeling indicates that the mutations may affect AFG3L2 substrate handling. This work identifies AFG3L2 as a novel cause of dominant neurodegenerative disease and indicates a previously unknown role for this component of the mitochondrial protein quality control machinery in protecting the human cerebellum against neurodegeneration.

%X Here, we use a large-scale cell line-based approach to identify cancer cell-specific mutations that are associated with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) dependence. For this purpose, we profiled the mutational landscape across 1,319 cancer-associated genes of 67 distinct cell lines and identified numerous genes involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PAXIP, and RAD50, as being associated with non-oncogene addiction to DNA-PKcs. Mutations in the mismatch repair gene MSH3, which have been reported to occur recurrently in numerous human cancer entities, emerged as the most significant predictors of DNA-PKcs addiction. Concordantly, DNA-PKcs inhibition robustly induced apoptosis in MSH3-mutant cell lines in vitro and displayed remarkable single-agent efficacy against MSH3-mutant tumors in vivo. Thus, we here identify a therapeutically actionable synthetic lethal interaction between MSH3 and the non-homologous end joining kinase DNA-PKcs. Our observations recommend DNA-PKcs inhibition as a therapeutic concept for the treatment of human cancers displaying homologous recombination defects.

%X Soluble sulfotransferases (SULTs) generate electrophilically reactive metabolites from numerous food-borne compounds, environmental contaminants and drugs, often resulting in mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Substrate specificity, regulation and tissue distribution of SULTs show large interspecies differences. In humans, therefore, SULTs may be involved in the induction of cancer in different tissues than in standard animal models. To construct a rodent model taking some species differences into account, we transferred a 68.5 kb human (h) genomic sequence that comprised the transcribed and long flanking regions of SULT1A1 and 1A2 into murine oocytes. This approach resulted in several mouse lines expressing these human genes in a copy number-dependent manner with a tissue distribution similar to that in humans. In previous in vitro studies, we had demonstrated that human SULT1A1 and 1A2 efficiently catalyze the terminal activation of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) to a mutagen. The transgenic mice were used to study the hSULT1A1/1A2-mediated activation. Tissue distribution and levels of DNA adducts were determined in hSULT1A1/1A2 transgenic and wild-type mice after an oral dosage of PhIP. Transgenic mice exhibited significantly elevated PhIP-DNA adduct levels compared with the wild-type in liver (13-fold), lung (3.8-fold), colon (2-fold), kidney (1.6-fold) and cecum (1.5-fold). Moreover, among the eight tissues examined, liver was the one with the lowest and highest adduct levels in wild-type and transgenic mice, respectively. Hence, expression of hSULT1A1/1A2 not only enhanced the genotoxicity but also substantially changed the organotropism of PhIP.

%X DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) not only interrupt the genetic information, but also disrupt the chromatin structure, and both impairments require repair mechanisms to ensure genome integrity. We showed previously that RNF8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by promoting the accumulation of repair factors at DSBs. Here, we provide evidence that, while RNF8 is necessary to trigger the DSB-associated ubiquitylations, it is not sufficient to sustain conjugated ubiquitin in this compartment. We identified RNF168 as a novel chromatin-associated ubiquitin ligase with an ability to bind ubiquitin. We show that RNF168 interacts with ubiquitylated H2A, assembles at DSBs in an RNF8-dependent manner, and, by targeting H2A and H2AX, amplifies local concentration of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates to the threshold required for retention of 53BP1 and BRCA1. Thus, RNF168 defines a new pathway involving sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes and uncovers a functional cooperation between E3 ligases in genome maintenance.

%X Heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations (mutations present only in a subset of cellular mtDNA copies) arise de novo during the normal ageing process or may be maternally inherited in pedigrees with mitochondrial disease syndromes. A pathogenic mtDNA mutation causes respiratory chain deficiency only if the fraction of mutated mtDNA exceeds a certain threshold level. These mutations often undergo apparently random mitotic segregation and the levels of normal and mutated mtDNA can vary considerably between cells of the same tissue. In human ageing, segregation of somatic mtDNA mutations leads to mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in a variety of tissues, such as brain, heart and skeletal muscle. A similar pattern of mutation segregation with mosaic respiratory chain deficiency is seen in patients with mitochondrial disease syndromes caused by inherited pathogenic mtDNA mutations. We have experimentally addressed the role of mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in ageing and mitochondrial disease by creating mouse chimeras with a mixture of normal and respiratory chain-deficient neurons in cerebral cortex. We report here that a low proportion (>20%) of respiratory chain-deficient neurons in the forebrain are sufficient to cause symptoms, whereas premature death of the animal occurs only if the proportion is high (>60-80%). The presence of neurons with normal respiratory chain function does not only prevent mortality but also delays the age at which onset of disease symptoms occur. Unexpectedly, respiratory chain-deficient neurons have adverse effect on normal adjacent neurons and induce trans-neuronal degeneration. In summary, our study defines the minimal threshold level of respiratory chain-deficient neurons needed to cause symptoms and also demonstrate that neurons with normal respiratory chain function ameliorate disease progression. Finally, we show that respiratory chain-deficient neurons induce death of normal neurons by a trans-neuronal degeneration mechanism. These findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in ageing and mitochondrial disease.

%X The morphology of mitochondria in mammalian cells is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of OPA1, a dynamin-like GTPase of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The mitochondrial rhomboid protease PARL, and paraplegin, a subunit of the ATP-dependent m-AAA protease, were proposed to be involved in this process. Here, we characterized individual OPA1 isoforms by mass spectrometry, and we reconstituted their processing in yeast to identify proteases involved in OPA1 cleavage. The yeast homologue of OPA1, Mgm1, was processed both by PARL and its yeast homologue Pcp1. Neither of these rhomboid proteases cleaved OPA1. The formation of small OPA1 isoforms was impaired in yeast cells lacking the m-AAA protease subunits Yta10 and Yta12 and was restored upon expression of murine or human m-AAA proteases. OPA1 processing depended on the subunit composition of mammalian m-AAA proteases. Homo-oligomeric m-AAA protease complexes composed of murine Afg3l1, Afg3l2, or human AFG3L2 subunits cleaved OPA1 with higher efficiency than paraplegin-containing m-AAA proteases. OPA1 processing proceeded normally in murine cell lines lacking paraplegin or PARL. Our results provide evidence for different substrate specificities of m-AAA proteases composed of different subunits and reveal a striking evolutionary switch of proteases involved in the proteolytic processing of dynamin-like GTPases in mitochondria.

%X Cell-matrix adhesions provide structural stability to the tissue and regulate intracellular signalling pathways that are important for cell fate decisions of the different cell populations within the skin. As a consequence of these central functions, genetic or functional impairment of various key protein components of matrix adhesions plays a causative role in the aetiology or pathophysiology in a large variety of skin disorders. Research towards understanding the molecular composition of these adhesions as well as the mechanisms by which they transmit signals is therefore of obvious importance. In this essay, we discuss the roles of integrin-linked kinase, a key component of cell-matrix adhesions, in the (patho)physiology of skin and in particular highlight its role in regulating mechanical tension and matrix remodelling both in the epidermis and in the dermis.

%X The mtDNA mutator mice have high levels of point mutations and linear deletions of mtDNA causing a progressive respiratory chain dysfunction and a premature aging phenotype. We have now performed molecular analyses to determine the mechanism whereby these mtDNA mutations impair respiratory chain function. We report that mitochondrial protein synthesis is unimpaired in mtDNA mutator mice consistent with the observed minor alterations of steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts. These findings refute recent claims that circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions are driving the premature aging phenotype. We further show that the stability of several respiratory chain complexes is severely impaired despite normal synthesis of the corresponding mtDNA-encoded subunits. Our findings reveal a mechanism for induction of aging phenotypes by demonstrating a causative role for amino acid substitutions in mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunits, which, in turn, leads to decreased stability of the respiratory chain complexes and respiratory chain deficiency.

%X Mitochondrial fusion depends on the dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatase OPA1, whose activity is controlled by proteolytic cleavage. Dysfunction of mitochondria induces OPA1 processing and results in mitochondrial fragmentation, allowing the selective removal of damaged mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrate that two classes of metallopeptidases regulate OPA1 cleavage in the mitochondrial inner membrane: isoenzymes of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent matrix AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities [m-AAA]) protease, variable assemblies of the conserved subunits paraplegin, AFG3L1 and -2, and the ATP-independent peptidase OMA1. Functionally redundant isoenzymes of the m-AAA protease ensure the balanced accumulation of long and short isoforms of OPA1 required for mitochondrial fusion. The loss of AFG3L2 in mouse tissues, down-regulation of AFG3L1 and -2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, or the expression of a dominant-negative AFG3L2 variant in human cells decreases the stability of long OPA1 isoforms and induces OPA1 processing by OMA1. Moreover, cleavage by OMA1 causes the accumulation of short OPA1 variants if mitochondrial DNA is depleted or mitochondrial activities are impaired. Our findings link distinct peptidases to constitutive and induced OPA1 processing and shed new light on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders associated with mutations in m-AAA protease subunits.

%X Leptin-stimulated Stat3 activation in proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons of the hypothalamus plays an important role in maintenance of energy homeostasis. While Stat3 activation in POMC neurons is required for POMC expression, the role of elevated basal Stat3 activation as present in the development of obesity has not been directly addressed. Here, we have generated and characterized mice expressing a constitutively active version of Stat3 (Stat3-C) in POMC neurons (Stat3-C(POMC) mice). On normal chow diet, these animals develop obesity as a result of hyperphagia and decreased POMC expression accompanied by central leptin and insulin resistance. This unexpected finding coincides with POMC-cell-specific, Stat3-mediated upregulation of SOCS3 expression inhibiting both leptin and insulin signaling as insulin-stimulated PIP(3) (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 triphosphate) formation and protein kinase B (AKT) activation in POMC neurons as well as with the fact that insulin's ability to hyperpolarize POMC neurons is largely reduced in POMC cells of Stat3-C(POMC) mice. These data indicate that constitutive Stat3 activation is not sufficient to promote POMC expression but requires simultaneous PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-dependent release of FOXO1 repression. In contrast, upon exposure to a high-fat diet, food intake and body weight were unaltered in Stat3-C(POMC) mice compared with control mice. Taken together, these experiments directly demonstrate that enhanced basal Stat3 activation in POMC neurons as present in control mice upon high-fat feeding contributes to the development of hypothalamic leptin and insulin resistance.

%X Ubiquitin is a post-translational modifier with proteolytic and non-proteolytic roles in many biological processes. At mitochondria, it performs regulatory homeostatic functions and contributes to mitochondrial quality control. Ubiquitin is essential for mitochondrial fusion, regulates mitochondria-ER contacts, and participates in maternal mtDNA inheritance. Under stress, mitochondrial dysfunction induces ubiquitin-dependent responses that involve mitochondrial proteome remodeling and culminate in organelle removal by mitophagy. In addition, many ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms have been shown to regulate innate immune responses and xenophagy. Here, we review the emerging roles of ubiquitin at mitochondria.

%X Down-regulation of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) can increase lifespan in C. elegans, Drosophila and mice. In C. elegans, reduced IIS results in down-regulation of translation, which itself can extend lifespan. However, the effect of reduced IIS on translation has yet to be determined in other multicellular organisms. Using two long-lived IIS models, namely Drosophila lacking three insulin-like peptides (dilp2-3,5(-/-)) and mice lacking insulin receptor substrate 1 (Irs1(-/-)), and two independent translation assays, polysome profiling and radiolabeled amino acid incorporation, we show that reduced IIS lowers translation in these organisms. In Drosophila, reduced IIS decreased polysome levels in fat body and gut, but reduced the rate of protein synthesis only in the fat body. Reduced IIS in mice decreased protein synthesis rate only in skeletal muscle, without reducing polysomes in any tissue. This lowered translation in muscle was independent of Irs1 loss in the muscle itself, but a secondary effect of Irs1 loss in the liver. In conclusion, down-regulation of translation is an evolutionarily conserved response to reduced IIS, but the tissues in which it occurs can vary between organisms. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying lowered translation may differ in mice, possibly associated with the complexity of the regulatory processes.

%X Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) play highly conserved roles in development and physiology. Most animal genomes encode multiple ILPs. Here we identify mechanisms for how the forty Caenorhabditis elegans ILPs coordinate diverse processes, including development, reproduction, longevity and several specific stress responses. Our systematic studies identify an ILP-based combinatorial code for these phenotypes characterized by substantial functional specificity and diversity rather than global redundancy. Notably, we show that ILPs regulate each other transcriptionally, uncovering an ILP-to-ILP regulatory network that underlies the combinatorial phenotypic coding by the ILP family. Extensive analyses of genetic interactions among ILPs reveal how their signals are integrated. A combined analysis of these functional and regulatory ILP interactions identifies local genetic circuits that act in parallel and interact by crosstalk, feedback and compensation. This organization provides emergent mechanisms for phenotypic specificity and graded regulation for the combinatorial phenotypic coding we observe. Our findings also provide insights into how large hormonal networks regulate diverse traits.

%X Core Facilities (CF) for advanced light microscopy (ALM) have become indispensable support units for research in the life sciences. Their organizational structure and technical characteristics are quite diverse, although the tasks they pursue and the services they offer are similar. Therefore, throughout Europe, scientists from ALM-CFs are forming networks to promote interactions and discuss best practice models. Here, we present recommendations for ALM-CF operations elaborated by the workgroups of the German network of ALM-CFs, German Bio-Imaging (GerBI). We address technical aspects of CF planning and instrument maintainance, give advice on the organization and management of an ALM-CF, propose a scheme for the training of CF users, and provide an overview of current resources for image processing and analysis. Further, we elaborate on the new challenges and opportunities for professional development and careers created by CFs. While some information specifically refers to the German academic system, most of the content of this article is of general interest for CFs in the life sciences. Microsc. Res.

%X Because life is often unpredictable, dynamic, and complex, all animals have evolved remarkable abilities to cope with changes in their external environment and internal physiology. This regulatory plasticity leads to shifts in behavior and metabolism, as well as to changes in development, growth, and reproduction, which is thought to improve the chances of survival and reproductive success. In favorable environments, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans develops rapidly to reproductive maturity, but in adverse environments, animals arrest at the dauer diapause, a long-lived stress resistant stage. A molecular and genetic analysis of dauer formation has revealed key insights into how sensory and dietary cues are coupled to conserved endocrine pathways, including insulin/IGF, TGF-beta, serotonergic, and steroid hormone signal transduction, which govern the choice between reproduction and survival. These and other pathways reveal a molecular basis for metazoan plasticity in response to extrinsic and intrinsic signals.

%X Reduced food intake, avoiding malnutrition, can ameliorate aging and aging-associated diseases in invertebrate model organisms, rodents, primates, and humans. Recent findings indicate that meal timing is crucial, with both intermittent fasting and adjusted diurnal rhythm of feeding improving health and function, in the absence of changes in overall intake. Lowered intake of particular nutrients rather than of overall calories is also key, with protein and specific amino acids playing prominent roles. Nutritional modulation of the microbiome can also be important, and there are long-term, including inter-generational, effects of diet. The metabolic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms that mediate both improvement in health during aging to diet and genetic variation in the response to diet are being identified. These new findings are opening the way to specific dietary and pharmacological interventions to recapture the full potential benefits of dietary restriction, which humans can find difficult to maintain voluntarily.

%X Nowadays, identification of proteins from biological samples by mass spectrometry is widely used. In principle there are two scenarios. Proteins are pre-fractionated in some way, e.g. by gel electrophoresis or are analyzed as complex mixture (shot gun). Shot gun proteomics became recently more popular, because of technological developments on the mass spectrometer side which allows now the identification of several thousand proteins from complex biological matrix. However, in many cases it is still useful to separate proteins first in a gel. But not only mass spectrometer technology made progress. This is also true for the sample preparation. Recently, protocols and techniques were developed which make the analysis of starting material in the low microgram range possible and also simplify the whole procedure. Detailed protocols will be described allowing also inexperienced beginners to get good results.

%X Separation or prefractionation of proteins by gel electrophoresis, followed by in-gel proteolytic digest and analysis by MS is a typical standard application in proteomics. For many laboratories, it is not cost-effective to use a robot with all its drawbacks. On the other hand, manual digest is time consuming and not free of error if many samples are processed at the same time. The OASIS (R) HLB mu Elution plate allows the handling of 96 samples for protein in-gel digest and peptide desalting in a semiautomatic way. Using multichannel pipettes, solutions are added quickly, and with the use of the positive pressure-96 stand all solutions are removed simultaneously. In this article, a complete and detailed protocol for the use of the OASIS (R) HLB mu Elution plate is introduced and its effectiveness is shown with 2D- and 1D-gel samples.

%X Knowledge about the nature of pathomolecular alterations preceding onset of symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is largely lacking. It could not only pave the way for the discovery of valuable therapeutic targets but might also govern future concepts of pre-manifest disease modifying treatments. MicroRNAs are central regulators of transcriptome plasticity and participate in pathogenic cascades and/or mirror cellular adaptation to insults. We obtained comprehensive expression profiles of microRNAs in the serum of patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, asymptomatic mutation carriers and healthy control subjects. We observed a strikingly homogenous microRNA profile in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that was largely independent from the underlying disease gene. Moreover, we identified 24 significantly downregulated microRNAs in pre-manifest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutation carriers up to two decades or more before the estimated time window of disease onset; 91.7% of the downregulated microRNAs in mutation carriers overlapped with the patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a consensus sequence motif present in the vast majority of downregulated microRNAs identified in this study. Our data thus suggest specific common denominators regarding molecular pathogenesis of different amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes. We describe the earliest pathomolecular alterations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutation carriers known to date, which provide a basis for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and strongly argue for studies evaluating presymptomatic disease-modifying treatment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

%X In this issue, Pospisilik et al. (2007) demonstrate that a reduction in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation protects mice against obesity and diabetes. This finding suggests that the moderate deficiency in oxidative phosphorylation that is observed in peripheral tissues of insulin-resistant humans is not a causative factor in diabetes but may instead be a compensatory response.

%X The basal mitochondrial transcription machinery is essential for biogenesis of the respiratory chain and consists of mitochondrial RNA polymerase, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and mitochondrial transcription factor B2. This triad of proteins is sufficient and necessary for mtDNA transcription initiation. Abolished mtDNA transcription caused by tissue-specific knockout of TFAM in the mouse heart leads to early onset of a severe mitochondrial cardiomyopathy with lethality within the first post-natal weeks. Here, we describe a mouse model expressing human TFAM instead of the endogenous mouse TFAM in heart. These rescue mice have severe reduction in mtDNA transcription initiation, but, surprisingly, are healthy at the age of 52 weeks with near-normal steady-state levels of transcripts. In addition, we demonstrate that heavy-strand mtDNA transcription normally terminates at the termination-associated sequence in the control region. This termination is abolished in rescue animals resulting in heavy (H)-strand transcription of the entire control region. In conclusion, we demonstrate here the existence of an unexpected mtDNA transcript stabilization mechanism that almost completely compensates for the severely reduced transcription initiation in rescue hearts. Future elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism may provide a novel pathway to treat mitochondrial dysfunction in human pathology.

%X BACKGROUND: Coenzyme Q is an essential mitochondrial electron carrier, redox cofactor and a potent antioxidant in the majority of cellular membranes. Coenzyme Q deficiency has been associated with a range of metabolic diseases, as well as with some drug treatments and ageing. METHODS: We used whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate patients with inherited metabolic diseases and applied a novel ultra-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach to measure coenzyme Q in patient samples. RESULTS: We identified a homozygous missense mutation in the COQ7 gene in a patient with complex mitochondrial deficiency, resulting in severely reduced coenzyme Q levels We demonstrate that the coenzyme Q analogue 2,4-dihydroxybensoic acid (2,4DHB) was able to specifically bypass the COQ7 deficiency, increase cellular coenzyme Q levels and rescue the biochemical defect in patient fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: We report the first patient with primary coenzyme Q deficiency due to a homozygous COQ7 mutation and a potentially beneficial treatment using 2,4DHB.

%X The MitoPark mouse, in which the mitochondrial transcription factor Tfam is selectively removed in midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, is a genetic model for Parkinson's disease (PD) that replicates the slow and progressive development of key symptoms. To further validate this model, we have extended both behavioral and biochemical analyses in these animals. We found that vertical movements decline earlier and faster than horizontal movements, possibly modeling the early occurrence of axial, postural instability in PD. L-DOPA induces different locomotor responses depending on the age: in young MitoPark mice the L-DOPA-induced motor activation is small; middle-aged MitoPark mice respond in a dose-dependent manner to L-DOPA, whereas aged MitoPark mice display a double-peaked locomotor response to a high dose of L-DOPA that includes an intermittent period of very low motor activity, similar to the 'on-off' phenomenon in PD. To correlate behavior with biochemical data, we analyzed monoamine levels in three different brain areas that are highly innervated by the DA system: striatum, anterior cortex and olfactory bulb. DA levels declined earlier and faster in striatum than in cortex; only at the latest time-point analyzed, DA levels were found to be significantly lower than control levels in the olfactory bulb. Interestingly, the ratio between homovanillic acid (HVA) and DA differed between regions over time. In striatum and olfactory bulb, the ratio increased steeply indicating increased DA turnover. In contrast, the ratio decreased over time in cortex, revealing important differences between DA cells in substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.

%X Hormesis refers to the beneficial effects of a treatment that at a higher intensity is harmful. In one form of hormesis, sublethal exposure to stressors induces a response that results in stress resistance. The principle of stress-response hormesis is increasingly finding application in studies of aging, where hormetic increases in life span have been seen in several animal models.

%X Discovering the biological basis of aging is one of the greatest remaining challenges for science. Work on the biology of aging has discovered a range of interventions and pathways that control aging rate. A picture is emerging of a signaling network that is sensitive to nutritional status and that controls growth, stress resistance, and aging. This network includes the insulin/IGF-1 and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways and likely mediates the effects of dietary restriction on aging. Yet the biological processes upon which these pathways act to control life span remain unclear. A long-standing guiding assumption about aging is that it is caused by wear and tear, particularly damage at the molecular level. One view is that reactive oxygen species (ROS), including free radicals, generated as by-products of cellular metabolism, are a major contributor to this damage. Yet many recent tests of the oxidative damage theory have come up negative. Such tests have opened an exciting new phase in biogerontology in which fundamental assumptions about aging are being reexamined and revolutionary concepts are emerging. Among these concepts is the hyperfunction theory, which postulates that processes contributing to growth and reproduction run on in later life, leading to hypertrophic and hyperplastic pathologies. Here we reexamine central concepts about the nature of aging.

%X Mitochondrial AAA proteases play an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis. They regulate and promote biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins by acting as processing enzymes and ensuring the selective turnover of misfolded proteins. Impairment of AAA proteases causes pleiotropic defects in various organisms including neurodegeneration in humans. AAA proteases comprise ring-like hexameric complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane and are functionally conserved from yeast to man, but variations are evident in the subunit composition of orthologous enzymes. Recent structural and biochemical studies revealed how AAA proteases degrade their substrates in an ATP dependent manner. Intersubunit coordination of the ATP hydrolysis leads to an ordered ATP hydrolysis within the AAA ring, which ensures efficient substrate dislocation from the membrane and translocation to the proteolytic chamber. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the versatile functions of mitochondrial AAA proteases and their relevance to those of the other AAA+ machines.

%X ILK (integrin-linked kinase) is a central component of cell-matrix adhesions and an important regulator of integrin function. It forms a ternary complex with two other adaptor proteins, PINCH (particularly interesting cysteine- and histidine-rich protein) and parvin, forming the IPP (ILK-PINCH-parvin) complex that regulates the integrin-actin linkage as well as microtubule dynamics. These functions are essential for processes such as cell migration and matrix remodelling. The present review discusses the recent advances on the structural and functional characterization of ILK and the long-standing debate regarding its reported kinase activity.

%X Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) alter female behaviour and physiology and can mediate sexual conflict. In Drosophila melanogaster, a single Sfp, the sex peptide (SP), triggers remarkable post-mating responses in females, including altered fecundity, feeding, immunity and sexual receptivity. These effects can favour the evolutionary interests of males while generating costs in females. We tested the hypothesis that SP is an upstream master-regulator able to induce diverse phenotypes through efficient induction of widespread transcriptional changes in females. We profiled mRNA responses to SP in adult female abdomen (Abd) and head+thorax (HT) tissues using microarrays at 3 and 6 h following mating. SP elicited a rich, subtle signature of temporally and spatially controlled mRNAs. There were significant alterations to genes linked to egg development, early embryogenesis, immunity, nutrient sensing, behaviour and, unexpectedly, phototransduction. There was substantially more variation in the direction of differential expression across time points in the HT versus Abd. The results support the idea that SP is an important regulator of gene expression in females. The expression of many genes in one sex can therefore be under the influence of a regulator expressed in the other. This could influence the extent of sexual conflict both within and between loci.

%X Covalent conjugation of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to target proteins regulates many important eukaryotic cellular mechanisms. Although the molecular consequences of the conjugation of SUMO proteins are relatively well understood, little is known about the cellular signals that regulate the modification of their substrates. Here, we show that SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are required for cells to survive heat shock. Through quantitative labeling techniques, stringent purification of SUMOylated proteins, advanced mass spectrometric technology, and novel techniques of data analysis, we quantified heat shock-induced changes in the SUMOylation state of 766 putative substrates. In response to heat shock, SUMO was polymerized into polySUMO chains and redistributed among a wide range of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation; apoptosis; the trafficking, folding, and degradation of proteins; transcription; translation; and DNA replication, recombination, and repair. This comprehensive proteomic analysis of the substrates of a ubiquitin-like modifier (Ubl) identifies a pervasive role for SUMO proteins in the biologic response to hyperthermic stress.

%X The risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases dramatically with age. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of brain aging is crucial for developing preventative and/or therapeutic approaches for age-associated neurological diseases. Recently, it has been suggested that epigenetic factors, such as histone modifications, maybe be involved in brain aging and age-related neurodegenerations. In this study, we investigated 14 histone modifications in brains of a cohort of young (3 months), old (22 months), and old age-matched dietary restricted (DR) and rapamycin treated BALB/c mice. Results showed that 7 out of all measured histone markers were changed drastically with age. Intriguingly, histone methylations in brain tissues, including H3K27me3, H3R2me2, H3K79me3 and H4K20me2 tend to disappear with age but can be partially restored by both DR and rapamycin treatment. However, both DR and rapamycin treatment also have a significant impact on several other histone modifications such as H3K27ac, H4K16ac, H4R3me2, and H3K56ac, which do not change as animal ages. This study provides the first evidence that a broad spectrum of histone modifications may be involved in brain aging. Besides, this study suggests that both DR and rapamycin may slow aging process in mouse brain via these underlying epigenetic mechanisms.

Mitochondrial damage may lead to PD, and neurotoxins affecting mitochondria are widely used to produce degeneration of the nigrostriatal circuitry. Deletion of the mitochondrial transcription factor A gene (Tfam) in C57BL6 mouse DA neurons leads to a slowly progressing parkinsonian phenotype in which motor impairment is first observed at ~12 wk of age. L-DOPA treatment improves motor dysfunction in these "MitoPark" mice, but this declines when DA neuron loss is more complete. To investigate early neurobiological events potentially contributing to PD, we compared the neurochemical and electrophysiological properties of the nigrostriatal circuit in behaviorally asymptomatic 6- to 8-wk-old MitoPark mice and age-matched control littermates. Release, but not uptake of DA, was impaired in MitoPark mouse striatal brain slices, and nigral DA neurons lacked characteristic pacemaker activity compared with control mice. Also, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channel function was reduced in MitoPark DA neurons, although HCN messenger RNA was unchanged. This study demonstrates altered nigrostriatal function that precedes behavioral parkinsonian symptoms in this genetic PD model. A full understanding of these presymptomatic cellular properties may lead to more effective early treatments of PD.

%X Complex organismal properties such as longevity can be transmitted across generations by non-genetic factors. Here we demonstrate that deletion of the C. elegans histone H3 lysine 4 dimethyl (H3K4me2) demethylase, spr-5, causes a trans-generational increase in lifespan. We identify a chromatin-modifying network, which regulates this lifespan extension. We further show that this trans-generational lifespan extension is dependent on a hormonal signaling pathway involving the steroid dafachronic acid, an activator of the nuclear receptor DAF-12. These findings suggest that loss of the demethylase SPR-5 causes H3K4me2 mis-regulation and activation of a known lifespan-regulating signaling pathway, leading to trans-generational lifespan extension.

%X Multicellular animals match costly activities, such as growth and reproduction, to the environment through nutrient-sensing pathways. The insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway plays key roles in growth, metabolism, stress resistance, reproduction, and longevity in diverse organisms including mammals. Invertebrate genomes often contain multiple genes encoding insulin-like ligands, including seven Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs). We investigated the evolution, diversification, redundancy, and functions of the DILPs, combining evolutionary analysis, based on the completed genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species, and functional analysis, based on newly-generated knock-out mutations for all 7 dilp genes in D. melanogaster. Diversification of the 7 DILPs preceded diversification of Drosophila species, with stable gene diversification and family membership, suggesting stabilising selection for gene function. Gene knock-outs demonstrated both synergy and compensation of expression between different DILPs, notably with DILP3 required for normal expression of DILPs 2 and 5 in brain neurosecretory cells and expression of DILP6 in the fat body compensating for loss of brain DILPs. Loss of DILP2 increased lifespan and loss of DILP6 reduced growth, while loss of DILP7 did not affect fertility, contrary to its proposed role as a Drosophila relaxin. Importantly, loss of DILPs produced in the brain greatly extended lifespan but only in the presence of the endosymbiontic bacterium Wolbachia, demonstrating a specific interaction between IIS and Wolbachia in lifespan regulation. Furthermore, loss of brain DILPs blocked the responses of lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction (DR) and the DR response of these mutants suggests that IIS extends lifespan through mechanisms that both overlap with those of DR and through additional mechanisms that are independent of those at work in DR. Evolutionary conservation has thus been accompanied by synergy, redundancy, and functional differentiation between DILPs, and these features may themselves be of evolutionary advantage.

%X Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), their binding proteins and their receptors play important roles in regulating growth, metabolism, proliferation and survival for many cells and tissues throughout lifespan in humans and other species. Circulating IGF1 is known to be an endocrine regulator, with metabolic effects related to, and partly convergent with, insulin signalling. IGF1 also mediates many of the growth promoting effects of GH, and there is an ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of endocrine-, vs locally-derived IGF1 for systemic growth. More recently however, it has become clear that IGFs may be key local growth and cellular survival factors for many different tissues, active from early in embryonic development, essential for normal maturation and growth during foetal life. IGFs continue to play important roles throughout adult life in many diverse processes such as tissue repair, cellular proliferation, tissue remodelling and metabolic regulation. IGF systems are tightly regulated, orderly control of cellular repair and metabolism is central to healthy ageing, whilst uncontrolled proliferation can lead to cancer.

%X Genetic analysis using experimentally induced mutations has been a most valuable tool in the analysis of various organisms. However, genetic analysis of endoparasitic organisms tends to be difficult because of the limited accessibility of the sexually reproducing adults, which are normally located within the host. Nematodes of the genera Strogyloides and Parastrongyloides represent an exception to this because they can form facultative free-living sexually reproducing generations in between parasitic generations. Here we present a protocol for the chemical mutagenesis of Strongyloides ratti. Further we evaluate the feasibility of identifying the induced mutations by whole genome re-sequencing.

%X MOTIVATION: The identification of active transcriptional regulatory elements is crucial to understand regulatory networks driving cellular processes such as cell development and the onset of diseases. It has recently been shown that chromatin structure information, such as DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS) or histone modifications, significantly improves cell-specific predictions of transcription factor binding sites. However, no method has so far successfully combined both DHS and histone modification data to perform active binding site prediction. RESULTS: We propose here a method based on hidden Markov models to integrate DHS and histone modifications occupancy for the detection of open chromatin regions and active binding sites. We have created a framework that includes treatment of genomic signals, model training and genome-wide application. In a comparative analysis, our method obtained a good trade-off between sensitivity versus specificity and superior area under the curve statistics than competing methods. Moreover, our technique does not require further training or sequence information to generate binding location predictions. Therefore, the method can be easily applied on new cell types and allow flexible downstream analysis such as de novo motif finding. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our framework is available as part of the Regulatory Genomics Toolbox.

%X Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 proteins that are essential for the function of the oxidative phosphorylation system, which is composed of four respiratory-chain complexes and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase. Remarkably, the maintenance and expression of mtDNA depend on the mitochondrial import of hundreds of nuclear-encoded proteins that control genome maintenance, replication, transcription, RNA maturation, and mitochondrial translation. The importance of this complex regulatory system is underscored by the identification of numerous mutations of nuclear genes that impair mtDNA maintenance and expression at different levels, causing human mitochondrial diseases with pleiotropic clinical manifestations. The basic scientific understanding of the mechanisms controlling mtDNA function has progressed considerably during the past few years, thanks to advances in biochemistry, genetics, and structural biology. The challenges for the future will be to understand how mtDNA maintenance and expression are regulated and to what extent direct intramitochondrial cross talk between different processes, such as transcription and translation, is important.

%X Variants of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are commonly used as markers to track human evolution because of the high sequence divergence and exclusive maternal inheritance. It is assumed that the inheritance is clonal, i.e. that mtDNA is transmitted between generations without germline recombination. In contrast to this assumption, a number of studies have reported the presence of recombinant mtDNA molecules in cell lines and animal tissues, including humans. If germline recombination of mtDNA is frequent, it would strongly impact phylogenetic and population studies by altering estimates of coalescent time and branch lengths in phylogenetic trees. Unfortunately, this whole area is controversial and the experimental approaches have been widely criticized as they often depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mtDNA and/or involve studies of transformed cell lines. In this study, we used an in vivo mouse model that has had germline heteroplasmy for a defined set of mtDNA mutations for more than 50 generations. To assess recombination, we adapted and validated a method based on cloning of single mtDNA molecules in the lambda phage, without prior PCR amplification, followed by subsequent mutation analysis. We screened 2922 mtDNA molecules and found no germline recombination after transmission of mtDNA under genetically and evolutionary relevant conditions in mammals.

%X A central challenge in experimental aging research is the lack of short-lived vertebrate models for genetic studies. Here we present a comprehensive protocol for efficient genome engineering in the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), which is the shortest-lived vertebrate in captivity with a median life span of 4-6 months. By taking advantage of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) system and the turquoise killifish genome, this platform enables the generation of knockout alleles via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and knock-in alleles via homology-directed repair (HDR). We include guidelines for guide RNA (gRNA) target design, embryo injection and hatching, germ-line transmission and for minimizing off-target effects. We also provide strategies for Tol2-based transgenesis and large-scale husbandry conditions that are critical for success. Because of the fast life cycle of the turquoise killifish, stable lines can be generated as rapidly as 2-3 months, which is much faster than other fish models. This protocol provides powerful genetic tools for studying vertebrate aging and aging-related diseases.

%X Regulation of mtDNA expression is critical for controlling oxidative phosphorylation capacity and has been reported to occur at several different levels in mammalian mitochondria. LRPPRC (leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein) has a key role in this regulation and acts at the post-transcriptional level to stabilize mitochondrial mRNAs, to promote mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylation, and to coordinate mitochondrial translation. However, recent studies have suggested that LRPPRC may have an additional intramitochondrial role by directly interacting with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase POLRMT to stimulate mtDNA transcription. In this study, we have further examined the intramitochondrial roles for LRPPRC by creating bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice with moderately increased LRPPRC expression and heterozygous Lrpprc knock-out mice with moderately decreased LRPPRC expression. Variation of LRPPRC levels in mice in vivo, occurring within a predicted normal physiological range, strongly affected the levels of an unprocessed mitochondrial precursor transcript (ND5-cytochrome b) but had no effect on steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts or de novo transcription of mtDNA. We further assessed the role of LRPPRC in mitochondrial transcription by performing size exclusion chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments in human cell lines and mice, but we found no interaction between LRPPRC and POLRMT. Furthermore, addition of purified LRPPRC to a recombinant human in vitro transcription system did not activate mtDNA transcription. On the basis of these data, we conclude that LRPPRC does not directly regulate mtDNA transcription but rather acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of mammalian mtDNA expression.

%X The skeletal muscle is a metabolically active tissue that secretes various proteins. These so-called myokines have been proposed to affect muscle physiology and to exert systemic effects on other tissues and organs. Yet, changes in the secretory profile may participate in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases. The present study aimed at characterizing the secretome of differentiated primary human skeletal muscle cells (hSkMC) derived from healthy, adult donors combining three different mass spectrometry based non-targeted approaches as well as one antibody based method. This led to the identification of 548 non-redundant proteins in conditioned media from hSkmc. For 501 proteins, significant mRNA expression could be demonstrated. Applying stringent consecutive filtering using SignalP, SecretomeP and ER_retention signal databases, 305 proteins were assigned as potential myokines of which 12 proteins containing a secretory signal peptide were not previously described. This comprehensive profiling study of the human skeletal muscle secretome expands our knowledge of the composition of the human myokinome and may contribute to our understanding of the role of myokines in multiple biological processes.

%X Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in a wide variety of species, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans HNF4alpha-related nuclear hormone receptor NHR-62 is required for metabolic and physiologic responses associated with DR-induced longevity. nhr-62 mediates the longevity of eat-2 mutants, a genetic mimetic of dietary restriction, and blunts the longevity response of DR induced by bacterial food dilution at low nutrient levels. Metabolic changes associated with DR, including decreased Oil Red O staining, decreased triglyceride levels, and increased autophagy are partly reversed by mutation of nhr-62. Additionally, the DR fatty acid profile is altered in nhr-62 mutants. Expression profiles reveal that several hundred genes induced by DR depend on the activity of NHR-62, including a putative lipase required for the DR response. This study provides critical evidence of nuclear hormone receptor regulation of the DR longevity response, suggesting hormonal and metabolic control of life span.

%X In eukaryotic cells, maintenance of cellular ATP stores depends mainly on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which in turn requires sufficient cellular oxygenation. The crucial role of proper oxygenation for cellular viability is reflected by involvement of several mechanisms, which sense hypoxia and regulate activities of respiratory complexes according to available oxygen concentrations. Here, we focus on mouse nitric oxide-associated protein 1 (mNOA1), which has been identified as an important component of the machinery that adjusts OXPHOS activity to oxygen concentrations. mNOA1 is an evolutionary conserved GTP-binding protein that is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial protein translation and respiration. We found that mNOA1 is located mostly in the mitochondrial matrix from where it interacts with several high molecular mass complexes, most notably with the complex IV of the respiratory chain and the prohibitin complex. Knock-down of mNOA1 impaired enzyme activity I+III, resulting in oxidative stress and eventually cell death. mNOA1 is transcriptionally regulated in an oxygen-sensitive manner. We propose that oxygen-dependent regulation of mNOA1 is instrumental to adjusting OXPHOS activity to oxygen availability, thereby controlling mitochondrial metabolism.

%X BACKGROUND: The phylum Apicomplexa comprises important unicellular human parasites such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium. Eimeria is the largest and most diverse genus of apicomplexan parasites and some species of the genus are the causative agent of coccidiosis, a disease economically devastating in poultry. We report a complete genome sequence of the mouse parasite Eimeria falciformis. We assembled and annotated the genome sequence to study host-parasite interactions in this understudied genus in a model organism host. RESULTS: The genome of E. falciformis is 44 Mb in size and contains 5,879 predicted protein coding genes. Comparative analysis of E. falciformis with Toxoplasma gondii shows an emergence and diversification of gene families associated with motility and invasion mainly at the level of the Coccidia. Many rhoptry kinases, among them important virulence factors in T. gondii, are absent from the E. falciformis genome. Surface antigens are divergent between Eimeria species. Comparisons with T. gondii showed differences between genes involved in metabolism, N-glycan and GPI-anchor synthesis. E. falciformis possesses a reduced set of transmembrane transporters and we suggest an altered mode of iron uptake in the genus Eimeria. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced diversity of genes required for host-parasite interaction and transmembrane transport allow hypotheses on host adaptation and specialization of a single host parasite. The E. falciformis genome sequence sheds light on the evolution of the Coccidia and helps to identify determinants of host-parasite interaction critical for drug and vaccine development.

%X Dopaminergic (DA) signaling governs the control of complex behaviors, and its deregulation has been implicated in a wide range of diseases. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of the Fto gene, encoding a nucleic acid demethylase, impairs dopamine receptor type 2 (D2R) and type 3 (D3R) (collectively, 'D2-like receptor')-dependent control of neuronal activity and behavioral responses. Conventional and DA neuron-specific Fto knockout mice show attenuated activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel conductance by cocaine and quinpirole. Impaired D2-like receptor-mediated autoinhibition results in attenuated quinpirole-mediated reduction of locomotion and an enhanced sensitivity to the locomotor- and reward-stimulatory actions of cocaine. Analysis of global N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification of mRNAs using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing in the midbrain and striatum of Fto-deficient mice revealed increased adenosine methylation in a subset of mRNAs important for neuronal signaling, including many in the DA signaling pathway. Several proteins encoded by these mRNAs had altered expression levels. Collectively, FTO regulates the demethylation of specific mRNAs in vivo, and this activity relates to the control of DA transmission.

%X Health during aging can be improved by genetic, dietary and pharmacological interventions. Many of these increase resistance to various stressors, including xenobiotics. Up-regulation of xenobiotic detoxification genes is a transcriptomic signature shared by long-lived nematodes, flies and mice, suggesting that protection of cells from toxicity of xenobiotics may contribute to longevity. Expression of genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification is controlled by evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators. Three closely related subgroups of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) have a major role, and these include DAF-12 and NHR-8 in C. elegans, DHR96 in Drosophila and FXR, LXRs, PXR, CAR and VDR in mammals. In the invertebrates, these NHRs have been experimentally demonstrated to play a role in extension of lifespan by genetic and environmental interventions. NHRs represent critical hubs in that they regulate detoxification enzymes with broad substrate specificities, metabolizing both endo- and xeno-biotics. They also modulate homeostasis of steroid hormones and other endogenous cholesterol derivatives and lipid metabolism, and these roles, as well as xenobiotic detoxification, may contribute to the effects of NHRs on lifespan and health during aging, an issue that is being increasingly addressed in C. elegans and Drosophila. Disentangling the contribution of these processes to longevity will require more precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which each is effected, including identification of ligands and co-regulators of NHRs, patterns of tissue-specificity and mechanisms of interaction between tissues. The roles of vertebrate NHRs in determination of health during aging and lifespan have yet to be investigated.

%X Temperature potently modulates various physiologic processes including organismal motility, growth rate, reproduction, and ageing. In ectotherms, longevity varies inversely with temperature, with animals living shorter at higher temperatures. Thermal effects on lifespan and other processes are ascribed to passive changes in metabolic rate, but recent evidence also suggests a regulated process. Here, we demonstrate that in response to temperature, daf-41/ZC395.10, the C. elegans homolog of p23 co-chaperone/prostaglandin E synthase-3, governs entry into the long-lived dauer diapause and regulates adult lifespan. daf-41 deletion triggers constitutive entry into the dauer diapause at elevated temperature dependent on neurosensory machinery (daf-10/IFT122), insulin/IGF-1 signaling (daf-16/FOXO), and steroidal signaling (daf-12/FXR). Surprisingly, daf-41 mutation alters the longevity response to temperature, living longer than wild-type at 25 degrees C but shorter than wild-type at 15 degrees C. Longevity phenotypes at 25 degrees C work through daf-16/FOXO and heat shock factor hsf-1, while short lived phenotypes converge on daf-16/FOXO and depend on the daf-12/FXR steroid receptor. Correlatively daf-41 affected expression of DAF-16 and HSF-1 target genes at high temperature, and nuclear extracts from daf-41 animals showed increased occupancy of the heat shock response element. Our studies suggest that daf-41/p23 modulates key transcriptional changes in longevity pathways in response to temperature.

%X Developmental timing genes catalyze stem cell progression and animal maturation programs across taxa. Caenorhabditis elegans DRE-1/FBXO11 functions in an SCF E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to regulate the transition to adult programs, but its cognate proteolytic substrates are unknown. Here, we identify the conserved transcription factor BLMP-1 as a substrate of the SCF(DRE-1/FBXO11) complex. blmp-1 deletion suppressed dre-1 mutant phenotypes and exhibited developmental timing defects opposite to dre-1. blmp-1 also opposed dre-1 for other life history traits, including entry into the dauer diapause and longevity. BLMP-1 protein was strikingly elevated upon dre-1 depletion and dysregulated in a stage- and tissue-specific manner. The role of DRE-1 in regulating BLMP-1 stability is evolutionary conserved, as we observed direct protein interaction and degradation function for worm and human counterparts. Taken together, posttranslational regulation of BLMP-1/BLIMP-1 by DRE-1/FBXO11 coordinates C. elegans developmental timing and other life history traits, suggesting that this two-protein module mediates metazoan maturation processes.

%X Tissue shape emerges from the collective mechanical properties and behavior of individual cells and the ways by which they integrate into the surrounding tissue. Tissue architecture and its dynamic changes subsequently feed back to guide cell behavior. The skin is a dynamic, self-renewing barrier that is subjected to large-scale extrinsic mechanical forces throughout its lifetime. The ability to withstand this constant mechanical stress without compromising its integrity as a barrier requires compartment-specific structural specialization and the capability to sense and adapt to mechanical cues. This review discusses the unique mechanical properties of the skin and the importance of signals that arise from mechanical communication between cells and their environment.

%X Genome integrity in primordial germ cells (PGCs) is a prerequisite for fertility and species maintenance. In C. elegans, PGCs require global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) to remove UV-induced DNA lesions. Failure to remove the lesions leads to the activation of the C. elegans p53, CEP-1, resulting in mitotic arrest of the PGCs. We show that the eIF4E2 translation initiation factor IFE-4 in somatic gonad precursor (SGP) niche cells regulates the CEP-1/p53-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) in PGCs. We determine that the IFE-4 translation target EGL-15/FGFR regulates the non-cell-autonomous DDR that is mediated via FGF-like signaling. Using hair follicle stem cells as a paradigm, we demonstrate that the eIF4E2-mediated niche cell regulation of the p53 response in stem cells is highly conserved in mammals. We thus reveal that the somatic niche regulates the CEP-1/p53-mediated DNA damage checkpoint in PGCs. Our data suggest that the somatic niche impacts the stability of heritable genomes.

%X BACKGROUND: Perturbation of epidermal barrier formation will profoundly compromise overall skin function, leading to a dry and scaly, ichthyosis-like skin phenotype that is the hallmark of a broad range of skin diseases, including ichthyosis, atopic dermatitis, and a multitude of clinical eczema variants. An overarching molecular mechanism that orchestrates the multitude of factors controlling epidermal barrier formation and homeostasis remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: Here we highlight a specific role of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling in epidermal barrier formation. METHODS: Epidermal mTORC2 signaling was specifically disrupted by deleting rapamycin-insensitive companion of target of rapamycin (Rictor), encoding an essential subunit of mTORC2 in mouse epidermis (epidermis-specific homozygous Rictor deletion [Ric(EKO)] mice). Epidermal structure and barrier function were investigated through a combination of gene expression, biochemical, morphological and functional analysis in Ric(EKO) and control mice. RESULTS: Ric(EKO) newborns displayed an ichthyosis-like phenotype characterized by dysregulated epidermal de novo lipid synthesis, altered lipid lamellae structure, and aberrant filaggrin (FLG) processing. Despite a compensatory transcriptional epidermal repair response, the protective epidermal function was impaired in Ric(EKO) mice, as revealed by increased transepidermal water loss, enhanced corneocyte fragility, decreased dendritic epidermal T cells, and an exaggerated percutaneous immune response. Restoration of Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation in mTORC2-deficient keratinocytes through expression of constitutive Akt rescued FLG processing. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a critical metabolic signaling relay of barrier formation in which epidermal mTORC2 activity controls FLG processing and de novo epidermal lipid synthesis during cornification. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into epidermal barrier formation and could open up new therapeutic opportunities to restore defective epidermal barrier conditions.

%X During embryonic and postnatal development, organs and tissues grow steadily to achieve their final size at the end of puberty. However, little is known about the cellular dynamics that mediate postnatal growth. By combining in vivo clonal lineage tracing, proliferation kinetics, single-cell transcriptomics, and in vitro micro-pattern experiments, we resolved the cellular dynamics taking place during postnatal skin epidermis expansion. Our data revealed that harmonious growth is engineered by a single population of developmental progenitors presenting a fixed fate imbalance of self-renewing divisions with an ever-decreasing proliferation rate. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that epidermal developmental progenitors form a more uniform population compared with adult stem and progenitor cells. Finally, we found that the spatial pattern of cell division orientation is dictated locally by the underlying collagen fiber orientation. Our results uncover a simple design principle of organ growth where progenitors and differentiated cells expand in harmony with their surrounding tissues.

%X Tissue homeostasis requires maintenance of functional integrity under stress. A central source of stress is mechanical force that acts on cells, their nuclei, and chromatin, but how the genome is protected against mechanical stress is unclear. We show that mechanical stretch deforms the nucleus, which cells initially counteract via a calcium-dependent nuclear softening driven by loss of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. The resulting changes in chromatin rheology and architecture are required to insulate genetic material from mechanical force. Failure to mount this nuclear mechanoresponse results in DNA damage. Persistent, high-amplitude stretch induces supracellular alignment of tissue to redistribute mechanical energy before it reaches the nucleus. This tissue-scale mechanoadaptation functions through a separate pathway mediated by cell-cell contacts and allows cells/tissues to switch off nuclear mechanotransduction to restore initial chromatin state. Our work identifies an unconventional role of chromatin in altering its own mechanical state to maintain genome integrity in response to deformation.

%X Stem cells reside in specialized niches that are critical for their function. Upon activation, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) exit their niche to generate the outer root sheath (ORS), but a subset of ORS progeny returns to the niche to resume an SC state. Mechanisms of this fate reversibility are unclear. We show that the ability of ORS cells to return to the SC state requires suppression of a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and glutamine metabolism that occurs during early HFSC lineage progression. HFSC fate reversibility and glutamine metabolism are regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-Akt signaling axis within the niche. Deletion of mTORC2 results in a failure to re-establish the HFSC niche, defective hair follicle regeneration, and compromised long-term maintenance of HFSCs. These findings highlight the importance of spatiotemporal control of SC metabolic states in organ homeostasis.

%X Articular cartilage protects and lubricates joints for smooth motion and transmission of loads. Owing to its high water content, chondrocytes within the cartilage are exposed to high levels of hydrostatic pressure, which has been shown to promote chondrocyte identity through unknown mechanisms. Here, we investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressure on chondrocyte state and behavior, and discover that application of hydrostatic pressure promotes chondrocyte quiescence and prevents maturation towards the hypertrophic state. Mechanistically, hydrostatic pressure reduces the amount of trimethylated H3K9 (K3K9me3)-marked constitutive heterochromatin and concomitantly increases H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Reduced levels of H3K9me3 attenuates expression of pre-hypertrophic genes, replication and transcription, thereby reducing replicative stress. Conversely, promoting replicative stress by inhibition of topoisomerase II decreases Sox9 expression, suggesting that it enhances chondrocyte maturation. Our results reveal how hydrostatic pressure triggers chromatin remodeling to impact cell fate and function.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

%X The precise spatiotemporal control of cell proliferation is key to the morphogenesis of epithelial tissues. Epithelial cell divisions lead to tissue crowding and local changes in force distribution, which in turn suppress the rate of cell divisions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this mechanical feedback are largely unclear. Here, we identify a critical requirement of B-plexin transmembrane receptors in the response to crowding-induced mechanical forces during embryonic skin development. Epidermal stem cells lacking B-plexins fail to sense mechanical compression, resulting in disinhibition of the transcriptional coactivator YAP, hyperproliferation, and tissue overgrowth. Mechanistically, we show that B-plexins mediate mechanoresponses to crowding through stabilization of adhesive cell junctions and lowering of cortical stiffness. Finally, we provide evidence that the B-plexin-dependent mechanochemical feedback is also pathophysiologically relevant to limit tumor growth in basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer. Our data define a central role of B-plexins in mechanosensation to couple cell density and cell division in development and disease.

%X The skin epidermis is attached to the underlying dermis by a laminin 332 (Lm332)-rich basement membrane. Consequently, loss of Lm332 leads to the severe blistering disorder epidermolysis bullosa junctionalis in humans and animals. Owing to the indispensable role of Lm332 in keratinocyte adhesion in vivo, the severity of the disease has limited research into other functions of the protein. We have conditionally disrupted Lm332 expression in basal keratinocytes of adult mice. Although blisters develop along the interfollicular epidermis, hair follicle basal cells provide sufficient anchorage of the epidermis to the dermis, making inducible deletion of the Lama3 gene compatible with life. Loss of Lm332 promoted the thickening of the epidermis and exaggerated desquamation. Global RNA expression analysis revealed major changes in the expression of keratins, cornified envelope proteins, and cellular stress markers. These modifications of the keratinocyte genetic program are accompanied by changes in cell shape and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These data indicate that loss of Lm332-mediated progenitor cell adhesion alters cell fate and disturbs epidermal homeostasis.

%X Stem cell differentiation is accompanied by increased mRNA translation. The rate of protein biosynthesis is influenced by the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine, which are essential for cell growth and stem cell maintenance. However, the role of polyamines as endogenous effectors of stem cell fate and whether they act through translational control remains obscure. Here, we investigate the function of polyamines in stem cell fate decisions using hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) organoids. Compared to progenitor cells, HFSCs showed lower translation rates, correlating with reduced polyamine levels. Surprisingly, overall polyamine depletion decreased translation but did not affect cell fate. In contrast, specific depletion of natural polyamines mediated by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT; also known as SAT1) activation did not reduce translation but enhanced stemness. These results suggest a translation-independent role of polyamines in cell fate regulation. Indeed, we identified N1-acetylspermidine as a determinant of cell fate that acted through increasing self-renewal, and observed elevated N1-acetylspermidine levels upon depilation-mediated HFSC proliferation and differentiation in vivo. Overall, this study delineates the diverse routes of polyamine metabolism-mediated regulation of stem cell fate decisions.

%X The mammary gland develops from the surface ectoderm during embryogenesis and proceeds through morphological phases defined as placode, hillock, bud, and bulb stages followed by branching morphogenesis. During this early morphogenesis, the mammary bud undergoes an invagination process where the thickened bud initially protrudes above the surface epithelium and then transforms to a bulb and sinks into the underlying mesenchyme. The signaling pathways regulating the early morphogenetic steps have been identified to some extent, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain ill defined. Here, we use 3D and 4D confocal microscopy to show that the early growth of the mammary rudiment is accomplished by migration-driven cell influx, with minor contributions of cell hypertrophy and proliferation. We delineate a hitherto undescribed invagination mechanism driven by thin, elongated keratinocytes-ring cells-that form a contractile rim around the mammary bud and likely exert force via the actomyosin network. Furthermore, we show that conditional deletion of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) impairs invagination, resulting in abnormal mammary bud shape.

%X The vascular system is precisely regulated to adjust blood flow to organismal demand, thereby guaranteeing adequate perfusion under varying physiological conditions. Mechanical forces, such as cyclic circumferential stretch, are among the critical stimuli that dynamically adjust vessel distribution and diameter, but the precise mechanisms of adaptation to changing forces are unclear. We find that endothelial monolayers respond to cyclic stretch by transient remodeling of the vascular endothelial cadherin-based adherens junctions and the associated actomyosin cytoskeleton. Time-resolved proteomic profiling reveals that this remodeling is driven by calcium influx through the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel, triggering Rho activation to increase actomyosin contraction. As the mechanical stimulus persists, calcium signaling is attenuated through transient down-regulation of Piezo1 protein. At the same time, filamins are phosphorylated to increase monolayer stiffness, allowing mechanoadaptation to restore junctional integrity despite continuing exposure to stretch. Collectively, this study identifies a biphasic response to cyclic stretch, consisting of an initial calcium-driven junctional mechanoresponse, followed by mechanoadaptation facilitated by monolayer stiffening.

%X Tissue turnover requires activation and lineage commitment of tissue-resident stem cells (SCs). These processes are impacted by ageing, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we addressed the mechanisms of ageing in murine hair follicle SCs (HFSCs) and observed a widespread reduction in chromatin accessibility in aged HFSCs, particularly at key self-renewal and differentiation genes, characterized by bivalent promoters occupied by active and repressive chromatin marks. Consistent with this, aged HFSCs showed reduced ability to activate bivalent genes for efficient self-renewal and differentiation. These defects were niche dependent as the transplantation of aged HFSCs into young recipients or synthetic niches restored SC functions. Mechanistically, the aged HFSC niche displayed widespread alterations in extracellular matrix composition and mechanics, resulting in mechanical stress and concomitant transcriptional repression to silence promoters. As a consequence, increasing basement membrane stiffness recapitulated age-related SC changes. These data identify niche mechanics as a central regulator of chromatin state, which, when altered, leads to age-dependent SC exhaustion.

%X Focal adhesions link the actomyosin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix regulating cell adhesion, shape, and migration. Adhesions are dynamically assembled and disassembled in response to extrinsic and intrinsic forces, but how the essential adhesion component intergrin-linked kinase (ILK) dynamically responds to mechanical force and what role ATP bound to this pseudokinase plays remains elusive. Here, we apply force-probe molecular dynamics simulations of human ILK:α-parvin coupled to traction force microscopy to explore ILK mechanotransducing functions. We identify two key saltbridge-forming arginines within the allosteric, ATP-dependent force-propagation network of ILK. Disrupting this network by mutation impedes parvin binding, focal adhesion stabilization, force generation, and thus migration. Under tension, ATP shifts the balance from rupture of the complex to protein unfolding, indicating that ATP increases the force threshold required for focal adhesion disassembly. Our study proposes a new role of ATP as an obligatory binding partner for structural and mechanical integrity of the pseudokinase ILK, ensuring efficient cellular force generation and migration.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

%X RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key players in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Precise knowledge about their binding sites is therefore critical to unravel their molecular function and to understand their role in development and disease. Individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) identifies protein-RNA crosslink sites on a genome-wide scale. The high resolution and specificity of this method are achieved by an intramolecular cDNA circularization step that enables analysis of cDNAs that truncated at the protein-RNA crosslink sites. Here, we describe the improved iCLIP protocol and discuss critical optimization and control experiments that are required when applying the method to new RBPs.

%X Chromosome segregation and cell division are essential, highly ordered processes that depend on numerous protein complexes. Results from recent RNA interference screens indicate that the identity and composition of these protein complexes is incompletely understood. Using gene tagging on bacterial artificial chromosomes, protein localization, and tandem-affinity purification-mass spectrometry, the MitoCheck consortium has analyzed about 100 human protein complexes, many of which had not or had only incompletely been characterized. This work has led to the discovery of previously unknown, evolutionarily conserved subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex and the gamma-tubulin ring complex--large complexes that are essential for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. The approaches we describe here are generally applicable to high-throughput follow-up analyses of phenotypic screens in mammalian cells.

%X The "Green Theory" of aging proposes that organismal lifespan is limited by the failure to repair molecular damage generated by a broad range of metabolic processes. Two specific predictions arise from this: (1) that these processes will produce a wide variety of stable but dysfunctional compounds that increase in concentration with age, and (2) that organisms maintained under conditions that extend lifespan will display a reduced rate of accumulation of such "molecular rubbish". To test these predictions, novel analytical techniques were developed to investigate the accumulation of damaged compounds in Drosophila melanogaster. Simple preparative techniques were developed to produce digests of whole D. melanogaster for use in three-dimensional (3D) fluorimetry and 1H NMR spectrometry. Cohorts of Drosophila maintained under normal conditions showed an age-related increase in signals consistent with damage whereas those maintained under conditions of low temperature and dietary restriction did not. 1H NMR revealed distinct age-associated spectral changes that will facilitate the identification of novel compounds that both increase and decrease during aging in this species. These findings are consistent with the predictions of the "Green Theory".

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in energy metabolism have been implicated in a variety of human diseases. Mitochondrial fusion is essential for maintenance of mitochondrial function and requires the prohibitin ring complex subunit prohibitin-2 (PHB2) at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we provide a link between PHB2 deficiency and hyperactive insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Deletion of PHB2 in podocytes of mice, terminally differentiated cells at the kidney filtration barrier, caused progressive proteinuria, kidney failure, and death of the animals and resulted in hyperphosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), a known mediator of the mTOR signaling pathway. Inhibition of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling system through genetic deletion of the insulin receptor alone or in combination with the IGF-1 receptor or treatment with rapamycin prevented hyperphosphorylation of S6RP without affecting the mitochondrial structural defect, alleviated renal disease, and delayed the onset of kidney failure in PHB2-deficient animals. Evidently, perturbation of insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling contributes to tissue damage in mitochondrial disease, which may allow therapeutic intervention against a wide spectrum of diseases.

%X Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of animal RNAs. To investigate possible circRNA functions, it is important to understand circRNA biogenesis. Besides human ALU repeats, sequence features that promote exon circularization are largely unknown. We experimentally identified circRNAs in C. elegans. Reverse complementary sequences between introns bracketing circRNAs were significantly enriched in comparison to linear controls. By scoring the presence of reverse complementary sequences in human introns, we predicted and experimentally validated circRNAs. We show that introns bracketing circRNAs are highly enriched in RNA editing or hyperediting events. Knockdown of the double-strand RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 significantly and specifically upregulated circRNA expression. Together, our data support a model of animal circRNA biogenesis in which competing RNA-RNA interactions of introns form larger structures that promote circularization of embedded exons, whereas ADAR1 antagonizes circRNA expression by melting stems within these interactions.

%X We used 197 Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines to perform a genome-wide association analysis for virgin female lifespan, using ~2M common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found considerable genetic variation in lifespan in the DGRP, with a broad-sense heritability of 0.413. There was little power to detect signals at a genome-wide level in single-SNP and gene-based analyses. Polygenic score analysis revealed that a small proportion of the variation in lifespan (~4.7%) was explicable in terms of additive effects of common SNPs (>/=2% minor allele frequency). However, several of the top associated genes are involved in the processes previously shown to impact ageing (eg, carbohydrate-related metabolism, regulation of cell death, proteolysis). Other top-ranked genes are of unknown function and provide promising candidates for experimental examination. Genes in the target of rapamycin pathway (TOR; Chrb, slif, mipp2, dredd, RpS9, dm) contributed to the significant enrichment of this pathway among the top-ranked 100 genes (p = 4.79x10(-06)). Gene Ontology analysis suggested that genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism are important for lifespan; including the InterPro term DUF227, which has been previously associated with lifespan determination. This analysis suggests that our understanding of the genetic basis of natural variation in lifespan from induced mutations is incomplete.

%X Targeted treatment of cancer with monoclonal antibodies has added to the beneficial outcome of patients. In an attempt to improve anti-tumor activity of monoclonal antibodies, multi-specific antibodies have entered the research arena. To date, only a few multi-specific constructs have entered phase III clinical trials, in contrast to classical monoclonal antibodies, which are the standard first-line therapy in several tumor entities. In this review, we will assess selected multi-specific antibodies in pre-clinical and clinical development that may be new treatment options for cancer patients in the very near future. We will further evaluate therapy modalities including the timely distribution or the combination of various therapeutic approaches and assess the potential role of multi-specific antibodies in cancer treatment.

%X Cancer that might develop as host natural killer (NK) cells fail to detect ligands for their activating NK receptors. Immunoligands represent promising immunotherapeutic tools to overcome this deficit. These are fusion proteins containing a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) to target an available tumor antigen and ULBP2 to activate host NK cells by targeting the activatory receptor NKG2D. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an integral non-shed type 2 membrane protein that is highly and specifically expressed on prostate epithelial cells and strongly upregulated in prostate cancer. Here, we compare the impact of various anti-PSMA immunoligand formats on the therapeutic efficacy against prostate carcinoma cells by activating NK cells via NKG2D. Shortening of the linker separating the heavy and light chain antibody domain leads to the formation of dimers, trimers, and higher molecular mass oligomers. NK cells are most efficiently activated by multimeric immunoligands, thus showing an altered cytokine release pattern. The high avidity format is also superior in in vitro NK-mediated tumor cell targeting as shown in cytotoxicity assays. Finally, the efficacy of a multimeric immunoligand is shown in a prostate carcinoma mouse xenograft model showing a strong activity against advanced established tumors.

%X Low environmental temperature and dietary restriction (DR) extend lifespan in diverse organisms. In the fruit fly Drosophila, switching flies between temperatures alters the rate at which mortality subsequently increases with age but does not reverse mortality rate. In contrast, DR acts acutely to lower mortality risk; flies switched between control feeding and DR show a rapid reversal of mortality rate. Dietary restriction thus does not slow accumulation of aging-related damage. Molecular species that track the effects of temperatures on mortality but are unaltered with switches in diet are therefore potential biomarkers of aging-related damage. However, molecular species that switch upon instigation or withdrawal of DR are thus potential biomarkers of mechanisms underlying risk of mortality, but not of aging-related damage. Using this approach, we assessed several commonly used biomarkers of aging-related damage. Accumulation of fluorescent advanced glycation end products (AGEs) correlated strongly with mortality rate of flies at different temperatures but was independent of diet. Hence, fluorescent AGEs are biomarkers of aging-related damage in flies. In contrast, five oxidized and glycated protein adducts accumulated with age, but were reversible with both temperature and diet, and are therefore not markers either of acute risk of dying or of aging-related damage. Our approach provides a powerful method for identification of biomarkers of aging.

%X Acute kidney injury is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality in the ageing population. Proteotoxic stress response pathways have been suggested to contribute to the development of acute renal injury. Recent evidence suggests that increased synthesis of N-glycan precursors in the hexosamine pathway as well as feeding of animals with aminosugars produced in the hexosamine pathway may increase stress resistance through reducing proteotoxic stress and alleviate pathology in model organisms. As feeding of the hexosamine pathway metabolite glucosamine to aged mice increased their life expectancy we tested whether supplementation of this aminosugar may also protect mice from acute kidney injury after renal ischemia and reperfusion. Animals were fed for 4 weeks ad libitum with standard chow or standard chow supplemented with 0.5% N-acetylglucosamine. Preconditioning with caloric restriction for four weeks prior to surgery served as a positive control for protective dietary effects. Whereas caloric restriction demonstrated the known protective effect both on renal function as well as survival in the treated animals, glucosamine supplementation failed to promote any protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury. These data show that although hexosamine pathway metabolites have a proven role in enhancing protein quality control and survival in model organisms oral glucosamine supplementation at moderate doses that would be amenable to humans does not promote protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury of the kidney.

%X Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that divide and fuse by remodeling an outer and inner membrane in response to developmental, physiological and stress stimuli. These events are coordinated by conserved dynamin-related GTPases. The dynamics of mitochondrial morphology require coordination with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to ensure faithful genome transmission, however, this process remains poorly understood. Mitochondrial division is linked to the segregation of mtDNA but how it affects cases of mtDNA heteroplasmy, where two or more mtDNA variants/mutations co-exist in a cell, is unknown. Segregation of heteroplasmic human pathogenic mtDNA mutations is a critical factor in the onset and severity of human mitochondrial diseases. Here, we investigated the coupling of mitochondrial morphology to the transmission and segregation of mtDNA in mammals by taking advantage of two genetically modified mouse models: one with a dominant-negative mutation in the dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1 or Dnm1l) that impairs mitochondrial fission and the other, heteroplasmic mice segregating two neutral mtDNA haplotypes (BALB and NZB). We show a tissue-specific response to mtDNA segregation from a defect in mitochondrial fission. Only mtDNA segregation in the hematopoietic compartment is modulated from impaired Dnm1l function. In contrast, no effect was observed in other tissues arising from the three germ layers during development and in mtDNA transmission through the female germline. Our data suggest a robust organization of a heteroplasmic mtDNA segregating unit across mammalian cell types that can overcome impaired mitochondrial division to ensure faithful transmission of the mitochondrial genome.

%X The development and lifespan of C. elegans are controlled by the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12, an important model for the vertebrate vitamin D and liver X receptors. As with its mammalian homologues, DAF-12 function is regulated by bile acid-like steroidal ligands; however, tools for investigating their biosynthesis and function in vivo are lacking. A flexible synthesis for DAF-12 ligands and masked ligand derivatives that enable precise temporal control of DAF-12 function was developed. For ligand masking, photocleavable amides of 5-methoxy-N-methyl-2-nitroaniline (MMNA) were introduced. MMNA-masked ligands are bioavailable and after incorporation into the worm, brief UV irradiation can be used to trigger the expression of DAF-12 target genes and initiate development from dauer larvae into adults. The in vivo release of DAF-12 ligands and other small-molecule signals by using photocleavable MMNA-masked ligands will enable functional studies with precise spatial and temporal resolution.

%X Transcription factors involved in the specification and differentiation of neurons often continue to be expressed in the adult brain, but remarkably little is known about their late functions. Nurr1, one such transcription factor, is essential for early differentiation of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons but continues to be expressed into adulthood. In Parkinson's disease, Nurr1 expression is diminished and mutations in the Nurr1 gene have been identified in rare cases of disease; however, the significance of these observations remains unclear. Here, a mouse strain for conditional targeting of the Nurr1 gene was generated, and Nurr1 was ablated either at late stages of mDA neuron development by crossing with mice carrying Cre under control of the dopamine transporter locus or in the adult brain by transduction of adeno-associated virus Cre-encoding vectors. Nurr1 deficiency in maturing mDA neurons resulted in rapid loss of striatal DA, loss of mDA neuron markers, and neuron degeneration. In contrast, a more slowly progressing loss of striatal DA and mDA neuron markers was observed after ablation in the adult brain. As in Parkinson's disease, neurons of the substantia nigra compacta were more vulnerable than cells in the ventral tegmental area when Nurr1 was ablated at late embryogenesis. The results show that developmental pathways play key roles for the maintenance of terminally differentiated neurons and suggest that disrupted function of Nurr1 and other developmental transcription factors may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.

%X Mitochondrial DNA has long been posited as a likely target of oxidative damage induced mutation during the ageing process. Research over the past decades has uncovered the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations in association with a mosaic pattern of cells displaying mitochondrial dysfunction in ageing individuals. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms are far less straightforward than originally anticipated. Recent research on mitochondria reveals that these genomes are far less helpless than originally envisioned. Additionally, new technologies have allowed us to analyze the mutational signatures of many more somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations, revealing surprising patterns that are inconsistent with a DNA-oxidative damage based hypothesis. In this review, we will discuss these recent observations and new insights into the eccentricities of mitochondrial genetics, and their impact on our understanding of mitochondrial mutations and their role in the ageing process. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Aging.

%X Mitochondria contain their own genetic system that provides subunits of the complexes driving oxidative phosphorylation. A quarter of the mitochondrial proteome participates in gene expression, but how all these factors are orchestrated and spatially organized is currently unknown. Here, we established a method to purify and analyze native and intact complexes of mitochondrial ribosomes. Quantitative mass spectrometry revealed extensive interactions of ribosomes with factors involved in all the steps of posttranscriptional gene expression. These interactions result in large expressosome-like assemblies that we termed mitochondrial organization of gene expression (MIOREX) complexes. Superresolution microscopy revealed that most MIOREX complexes are evenly distributed throughout the mitochondrial network, whereas a subset is present as nucleoid-MIOREX complexes that unite the whole spectrum of organellar gene expression. Our work therefore provides a conceptual framework for the spatial organization of mitochondrial protein synthesis that likely developed to facilitate gene expression in the organelle.

%X Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in diverse organisms and, in animal and cellular models, can delay a range of aging-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A better understanding of the mechanisms mediating these interactions, however, may reveal novel pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, and potential targets for disease-modifying treatments and biomarkers for disease progression. Drosophila models of AD have recently been developed and, due to their short lifespan and susceptibility to genetic manipulation, we have used the fly to investigate the molecular connections among diet, aging and AD pathology. DR extended lifespan in both Arctic mutant Abeta42 and WT 4R tau over-expressing flies, but the underlying molecular pathology was not altered and neuronal dysfunction was not prevented by dietary manipulation. Our data suggest that DR may alter aging through generalised mechanisms independent of the specific pathways underlying AD pathogenesis in the fly, and hence that lifespan-extending manipulations may have varying effects on aging and functional declines in aging-related diseases. Alternatively, our analysis of the specific effects of DR on neuronal toxicity downstream of Abeta and tau pathologies with negative results may simply confirm that the neuro-protective effects of DR are upstream of the initiating events involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

%X The PLA2G6 gene encodes a group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 beta enzyme that selectively hydrolyses glycerophospholipids to release free fatty acids. Mutations in PLA2G6 have been associated with disorders such as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type II and Karak syndrome. More recently, PLA2G6 was identified as the causative gene in a subgroup of patients with autosomal recessive early-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. Neuropathological examination revealed widespread Lewy body pathology and the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, supporting a link between PLA2G6 mutations and parkinsonian disorders. Here we show that knockout of the Drosophila homologue of the PLA2G6 gene, iPLA2-VIA, results in reduced survival, locomotor deficits and organismal hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that loss of iPLA2-VIA function leads to a number of mitochondrial abnormalities, including mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction, reduced ATP synthesis and abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, we show that loss of iPLA2-VIA is strongly associated with increased lipid peroxidation levels. We confirmed our findings using cultured fibroblasts taken from two patients with mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. Similar abnormalities were seen including elevated mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial membrane defects, as well as raised levels of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Finally, we demonstrated that deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids, which inhibit lipid peroxidation, were able to partially rescue the locomotor abnormalities seen in aged flies lacking iPLA2-VIA gene function, and restore mitochondrial membrane potential in fibroblasts from patients with PLA2G6 mutations. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that loss of normal PLA2G6 gene activity leads to lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent mitochondrial membrane abnormalities. Furthermore we show that the iPLA2-VIA knockout fly model provides a useful platform for the further study of PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration.

%X Cell division is fundamental for all organisms. Here we report a genome-scale RNA-mediated interference screen in HeLa cells designed to identify human genes that are important for cell division. We have used a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs for gene silencing and have used DNA content analysis to identify genes that induced cell cycle arrest or altered ploidy on silencing. Validation and secondary assays were performed to generate a nine-parameter loss-of-function phenoprint for each of the genes. These phenotypic signatures allowed the assignment of genes to specific functional classes by combining hierarchical clustering, cross-species analysis and proteomic data mining. We highlight the richness of our dataset by ascribing novel functions to genes in mitosis and cytokinesis. In particular, we identify two evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory networks that govern cytokinesis. Our work provides an experimental framework from which the systematic analysis of novel genes necessary for cell division in human cells can begin.

%X Membrane homeostasis affects mitochondrial dynamics, morphology, and function. Here we report genetic and proteomic data that reveal multiple interactions of Mdm33, a protein essential for normal mitochondrial structure, with components of phospholipid metabolism and mitochondrial inner membrane homeostasis. We screened for suppressors of MDM33 overexpression-induced growth arrest and isolated binding partners by immunoprecipitation of cross-linked cell extracts. These approaches revealed genetic and proteomic interactions of Mdm33 with prohibitins, Phb1 and Phb2, which are key components of mitochondrial inner membrane homeostasis. Lipid profiling by mass spectrometry of mitochondria isolated from Mdm33-overexpressing cells revealed that high levels of Mdm33 affect the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin, the two key inner membrane phospholipids. Furthermore, we show that cells lacking Mdm33 show strongly decreased mitochondrial fission activity indicating that Mdm33 is critical for mitochondrial membrane dynamics. Our data suggest that MDM33 functionally interacts with components important for inner membrane homeostasis and thereby supports mitochondrial division.

%X The mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component (mARC) was recently discovered as the fifth eukaryotic molybdenum cofactor-containing enzyme. The human genome encodes two mARC proteins, mARC1 and mARC2, sharing significant homologies with respect to sequence and function. Whereas mARC2 was identified as a mitochondrial enzyme, the subcellular localization of mARC1 has remained uncharacterized, although the similarity of both proteins suggested identical subcellular localizations. In addition, neither mARC1 nor mARC2 could be attributed unambiguously to one of the four mitochondrial subcompartments. Accordingly, mechanisms triggering the subcellular distribution of both enzymes have been unexplored so far. Here, we shed light on the subcellular localization of mARC1 and demonstrate that it is integrated into the outer mitochondrial membrane. The C-terminal catalytic domain of the protein remains exposed to the cytosol and confers an N((in))-C((out)) membrane orientation of mARC1. This localization is triggered by the N terminus of the enzyme, being composed of a weak N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and a downstream transmembrane helix. We demonstrate the transmembrane domain of mARC1 to be sufficient for mitochondrial targeting and the N-terminal targeting signal to function as a supportive receptor for the outer mitochondrial membrane. According to its localization and targeting mechanism, we classify mARC1 as a novel signal-anchored mitochondrial protein. During mitochondrial import, mARC1 is not processed, and membrane integration proceeds membrane potential independently but requires external ATP, which finally results in the assembly of mARC1 into high oligomeric protein complexes.

%X Myeloid cells are key regulators of tissue homeostasis and disease. Alterations in cell-autonomous insulin/IGF-1 signaling in myeloid cells have recently been implicated in the development of systemic inflammation and insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM). Impaired wound healing and inflammatory skin diseases are frequent DM-associated skin pathologies, yet the underlying mechanisms are elusive. In this study, we investigated whether myeloid cell-restricted IR/IGF-1R signaling provides a pathophysiologic link between systemic insulin resistance and the development of cutaneous inflammation. Therefore, we generated mice lacking both the insulin and IGF-1 receptor in myeloid cells (IR/IGF-1R(MKO)). Whereas the kinetics of wound closure following acute skin injury was similar in control and IR/IGF-1R(MKO) mice, in two different conditions of dermatitis either induced by repetitive topical applications of the detergent SDS or by high-dose UV B radiation, IR/IGF-1R(MKO) mice were protected from inflammation, whereas controls developed severe skin dermatitis. Notably, whereas during the early phase in both inflammatory conditions the induction of epidermal proinflammatory cytokine expression was similar in control and IR/IGF-1R(MKO) mice, during the late stage, epidermal cytokine expression was sustained in controls but virtually abrogated in IR/IGF-1R(MKO) mice. This distinct kinetic of epidermal cytokine expression was paralleled by proinflammatory macrophage activation in controls and a noninflammatory phenotype in mutants. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for a proinflammatory IR/IGF-1R-dependent pathway in myeloid cells that plays a critical role in the dynamics of an epidermal-dermal cross-talk in cutaneous inflammatory responses, and may add to the mechanistic understanding of diseases associated with disturbances in myeloid cell IR/IGF-1R signaling, including DM.

%X Type 2 diabetes (T2D) evolves when insulin secretion fails. Insulin release from the pancreatic beta cell is controlled by mitochondrial metabolism, which translates fluctuations in blood glucose into metabolic coupling signals. We identified a common variant (rs950994) in the human transcription factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) gene associated with reduced insulin secretion, elevated postprandial glucose levels, and future risk of T2D. Because islet TFB1M mRNA levels were lower in carriers of the risk allele and correlated with insulin secretion, we examined mice heterozygous for Tfb1m deficiency. These mice displayed lower expression of TFB1M in islets and impaired mitochondrial function and released less insulin in response to glucose in vivo and in vitro. Reducing TFB1M mRNA and protein in clonal beta cells by RNA interference impaired complexes of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. Consequently, nutrient-stimulated ATP generation was reduced, leading to perturbed insulin secretion. We conclude that a deficiency in TFB1M and impaired mitochondrial function contribute to the pathogenesis of T2D.

%X Abstract TPR proteins modulate the activity of molecular chaperones. Here, we describe the S. cerevisiae TPR protein Sgt2 as interaction partner of Ssa1 and Hsp104 and as a component of the GET pathway by interacting with Get5. The GET pathway mediates the sorting of tail-anchored (TA) proteins, harboring a C-terminal trans-membrane segment, to the ER membrane. S. cerevisiae sgt2Delta cells show partial defects in TA protein sorting. Sgt2 activity in vivo relies on its N- and C-terminal domains, whereas the central TPR domain and thus chaperone interactions are dispensable. We show that TA protein sorting defects are more severe in sgt2Delta get5Delta mutants compared to single knockouts. Furthermore, overproduction of Sgt2 becomes toxic to get3Delta but not to get5Delta cells. Together, these findings indicate an additional, Get5-independent role of Sgt2 in TA protein sorting, pointing to parallel pathways of substrate delivery to Get3.

%X The m-AAA protease subunit AFG(3)L(2) is involved in degradation and processing of substrates in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in AFG(3)L(2) are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia SCA28 in humans and impair axonal development and neuronal survival in mice. The loss of AFG(3)L(2) causes fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. However, the pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration in the absence of AFG(3)L(2) is still unclear. Here, we show that depletion of AFG(3)L(2) leads to a specific defect of anterograde transport of mitochondria in murine cortical neurons. We observe similar transport deficiencies upon loss of AFG(3)L(2) in OMA1-deficient neurons, indicating that they are not caused by OMA1-mediated degradation of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1 and inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. Treatment of neurons with antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine or vitamin E, or decreasing tau levels in axons restored mitochondrial transport in AFG(3)L(2)-depleted neurons. Consistently, tau hyperphosphorylation and activation of ERK kinases are detected in mouse neurons postnatally deleted for Afg3l2. We propose that reactive oxygen species signaling leads to cytoskeletal modifications that impair mitochondrial transport in neurons lacking AFG(3)L(2).

%X Dopaminergic midbrain neurons integrate signals on food palatability and food-associated reward into the complex control of energy homeostasis. To define the role of insulin receptor (IR) signaling in this circuitry, we inactivated IR signaling in tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing cells of mice (IR(DeltaTh)). IR inactivation in Th-expressing cells of mice resulted in increased body weight, increased fat mass, and hyperphagia. While insulin acutely stimulated firing frequency in 50% of dopaminergic VTA/SN neurons, this response was abolished in IR(DeltaTh) mice. Moreover, these mice exhibited an altered response to cocaine under food-restricted conditions. Taken together, these data provide in vivo evidence for a critical role of insulin signaling in catecholaminergic neurons to control food intake and energy homeostasis.

%X m-AAA proteases are ATP-dependent proteolytic machines in the inner membrane of mitochondria which are crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial activities. Conserved nuclear-encoded subunits, termed paraplegin, Afg3l1, and Afg3l2, form various isoenzymes differing in their subunit composition in mammalian mitochondria. Mutations in different m-AAA protease subunits are associated with distinct neuronal disorders in human. However, the biogenesis of m-AAA protease complexes or of individual subunits is only poorly understood. Here, we have examined the processing of nuclear-encoded m-AAA protease subunits upon import into mitochondria and demonstrate autocatalytic processing of Afg3l1 and Afg3l2. The mitochondrial processing peptidase MPP generates an intermediate form of Afg3l2 that is matured autocatalytically. Afg3l1 or Afg3l2 are also required for maturation of newly imported paraplegin subunits after their cleavage by MPP. Our results establish that mammalian m-AAA proteases can act as processing enzymes in vivo and reveal overlapping activities of Afg3l1 and Afg3l2. These findings might be of relevance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders associated with mutations in different m-AAA protease subunits.

%X The second messengers cAMP and cGMP activate their target proteins by binding to a conserved cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD). Here, we identify and characterize an entirely novel CNBD-containing protein called CRIS (cyclic nucleotide receptor involved in sperm function) that is unrelated to any of the other members of this protein family. CRIS is exclusively expressed in sperm precursor cells. Cris-deficient male mice are either infertile due to a lack of sperm resulting from spermatogenic arrest, or subfertile due to impaired sperm motility. The motility defect is caused by altered Ca(2+) regulation of flagellar beat asymmetry, leading to a beating pattern that is reminiscent of sperm hyperactivation. Our results suggest that CRIS interacts during spermiogenesis with Ca(2+)-regulated proteins that--in mature sperm--are involved in flagellar bending.

%X Mitochondria are vital in providing cellular energy via their oxidative phosphorylation system, which requires the coordinated expression of genes encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). Transcription of the circular mammalian mtDNA depends on a single mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT). Although the transcription initiation process is well understood, it is debated whether POLRMT also serves as the primase for the initiation of mtDNA replication. In the nucleus, the RNA polymerases needed for gene expression have no such role. Conditional knockout of Polrmt in the heart results in severe mitochondrial dysfunction causing dilated cardiomyopathy in young mice. We further studied the molecular consequences of different expression levels of POLRMT and found that POLRMT is essential for primer synthesis to initiate mtDNA replication in vivo. Furthermore, transcription initiation for primer formation has priority over gene expression. Surprisingly, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) exists in an mtDNA-free pool in the Polrmt knockout mice. TFAM levels remain unchanged despite strong mtDNA depletion, and TFAM is thus protected from degradation of the AAA(+) Lon protease in the absence of POLRMT. Last, we report that mitochondrial transcription elongation factor may compensate for a partial depletion of POLRMT in heterozygous Polrmt knockout mice, indicating a direct regulatory role of this factor in transcription. In conclusion, we present in vivo evidence that POLRMT has a key regulatory role in the replication of mammalian mtDNA and is part of a transcriptional mechanism that provides a switch between primer formation for mtDNA replication and mitochondrial gene expression.

%X Eukaryotic cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA (rho0 cells) were originally generated under artificial growth conditions utilizing ethidium bromide. The chemical is known to intercalate preferentially with the mitochondrial double-stranded DNA thereby interfering with enzymes of the replication machinery. Rho0 cell lines are highly valuable tools to study human mitochondrial disorders because they can be utilized in cytoplasmic transfer experiments. However, mutagenic effects of ethidium bromide onto the nuclear DNA cannot be excluded. To foreclose this mutagenic character during the development of rho0 cell lines, we developed an extremely mild, reliable and timesaving method to generate rho0 cell lines within 3-5 days based on an enzymatic approach. Utilizing the genes for the restriction endonuclease EcoRI and the fluorescent protein EGFP that were fused to a mitochondrial targeting sequence, we developed a CMV-driven expression vector that allowed the temporal expression of the resulting fusion enzyme in eukaryotic cells. Applied on the human cell line 143B.TK- the active protein localized to mitochondria and induced the complete destruction of endogenous mtDNA. Mouse and rat rho0 cell lines were also successfully created with this approach. Furthermore, the newly established 143B.TK- rho0 cell line was characterized in great detail thereby releasing interesting insights into the morphology and ultra structure of human rho0 mitochondria.

%X Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is packaged by mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) into mitochondrial nucleoids that are of key importance in controlling the transmission and expression of mtDNA. Nucleoid ultrastructure is poorly defined, and therefore we used a combination of biochemistry, superresolution microscopy, and electron microscopy to show that mitochondrial nucleoids have an irregular ellipsoidal shape and typically contain a single copy of mtDNA. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy revealed that nucleoid formation in vitro is a multistep process initiated by TFAM aggregation and cross-strand binding. Superresolution microscopy of cultivated cells showed that increased mtDNA copy number increases nucleoid numbers without altering their sizes. Electron cryo-tomography visualized nucleoids at high resolution in isolated mammalian mitochondria and confirmed the sizes observed by superresolution microscopy of cell lines. We conclude that the fundamental organizational unit of the mitochondrial nucleoid is a single copy of mtDNA compacted by TFAM, and we suggest a packaging mechanism.

%X Mitochondria contain mtDNA derived from the ancestral endosymbiont genome. Important subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system, which supplies cells with the energy currency ATP, are encoded by mtDNA. A naked mtDNA molecule is longer than a typical mitochondrion and is therefore compacted in vivo to form a nucleoprotein complex, denoted the mitochondrial nucleoid. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is the main factor packaging mtDNA into nucleoids and is also essential for mtDNA transcription initiation. The crystal structure of TFAM shows that it bends mtDNA in a sharp U-turn, which likely provides the structural basis for its dual functions. Super-resolution imaging studies have revealed that the nucleoid has an average diameter of approximately 100nm and frequently contains a single copy of mtDNA. In this review the structure of the mitochondrial nucleoid and its possible regulatory roles in mtDNA expression will be discussed.

%X Mammalian mtDNA is packaged in DNA-protein complexes denoted mitochondrial nucleoids. The organization of the nucleoid is a very fundamental question in mitochondrial biology and will determine tissue segregation and transmission of mtDNA. We have used a combination of stimulated emission depletion microscopy, enabling a resolution well below the diffraction barrier, and molecular biology to study nucleoids in a panel of mammalian tissue culture cells. We report that the nucleoids labeled with antibodies against DNA, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), or incorporated BrdU, have a defined, uniform mean size of approximately 100 nm in mammals. Interestingly, the nucleoid frequently contains only a single copy of mtDNA (average approximately 1.4 mtDNA molecules per nucleoid). Furthermore, we show by molecular modeling and volume calculations that TFAM is a main constituent of the nucleoid, besides mtDNA. These fundamental insights into the organization of mtDNA have broad implications for understanding mitochondrial dysfunction in disease and aging.

%X Considerable efforts have been made to understand the role of oxidative stress in age-related diseases and ageing. The mitochondrial free radical theory of ageing, which proposes that damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and other macromolecules caused by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cellular respiration drives ageing, has for a long time been the central hypothesis in the field. However, in contrast with this theory, evidence from an increasing number of experimental studies has suggested that mtDNA mutations may be generated by replication errors rather than by accumulated oxidative damage. Furthermore, interventions to modulate ROS levels in humans and animal models have not produced consistent results in terms of delaying disease progression and extending lifespan. A number of recent experimental findings strongly question the mitochondrial free radical theory of ageing, leading to the emergence of new theories of how age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to ageing. These new hypotheses are mainly based on the underlying notion that, despite their deleterious role, ROS are essential signalling molecules that mediate stress responses in general and the stress response to age-dependent damage in particular. This novel view of ROS roles has a clear impact on the interpretation of studies in which antioxidants have been used to treat human age-related diseases commonly linked to oxidative stress.

%X We have studied the in vivo role of SLIRP in regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene expression and show here that it stabilizes its interacting partner protein LRPPRC by protecting it from degradation. Although SLIRP is completely dependent on LRPPRC for its stability, reduced levels of LRPPRC persist in the absence of SLIRP in vivo. Surprisingly, Slirp knockout mice are apparently healthy and only display a minor weight loss, despite a 50-70% reduction in the steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded mRNAs. In contrast to LRPPRC, SLIRP is dispensable for polyadenylation of mtDNA-encoded mRNAs. Instead, deep RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of mitochondrial ribosomal fractions and additional molecular analyses show that SLIRP is required for proper association of mRNAs to the mitochondrial ribosome and efficient translation. Our findings thus establish distinct functions for SLIRP and LRPPRC within the LRPPRC-SLIRP complex, with a novel role for SLIRP in mitochondrial translation. Very surprisingly, our results also demonstrate that mammalian mitochondria have a great excess of transcripts under basal physiological conditions in vivo.

%X ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification that can alter the physical and chemical properties of target proteins and that controls many important cellular processes. Macrodomains are evolutionarily conserved structural domains that bind ADP-ribose derivatives and are found in proteins with diverse cellular functions. Some proteins from the macrodomain family can hydrolyze ADP-ribosylated substrates and therefore reverse this post-translational modification. Bacteria and Streptomyces, in particular, are known to utilize protein ADP-ribosylation, yet very little is known about their enzymes that synthesize and remove this modification. We have determined the crystal structure and characterized, both biochemically and functionally, the macrodomain protein SCO6735 from Streptomyces coelicolor This protein is a member of an uncharacterized subfamily of macrodomain proteins. Its crystal structure revealed a highly conserved macrodomain fold. We showed that SCO6735 possesses the ability to hydrolyze PARP-dependent protein ADP-ribosylation. Furthermore, we showed that expression of this protein is induced upon DNA damage and that deletion of this protein in S. coelicolor increases antibiotic production. Our results provide the first insights into the molecular basis of its action and impact on Streptomyces metabolism.

%X BACKGROUND: African weakly-electric fishes of the family Mormyridae are able to produce and perceive weak electric signals (typically less than one volt in amplitude) owing to the presence of a specialized, muscle-derived electric organ (EO) in their tail region. Such electric signals, also known as Electric Organ Discharges (EODs), are used for objects/prey localization, for the identification of conspecifics, and in social and reproductive behaviour. This feature might have promoted the adaptive radiation of this family by acting as an effective pre-zygotic isolation mechanism. Despite the physiological and evolutionary importance of this trait, the investigation of the genetic basis of its function and modification has so far remained limited. In this study, we aim at: i) identifying constitutive differences in terms of gene expression between electric organ and skeletal muscle (SM) in two mormyrid species of the genus Campylomormyrus: C. compressirostris and C. tshokwe, and ii) exploring cross-specific patterns of gene expression within the two tissues among C. compressirostris, C. tshokwe, and the outgroup species Gnathonemus petersii. RESULTS: Twelve paired-end (100 bp) strand-specific RNA-seq Illumina libraries were sequenced, producing circa 330 M quality-filtered short read pairs. The obtained reads were assembled de novo into four reference transcriptomes. In silico cross-tissue DE-analysis allowed us to identify 271 shared differentially expressed genes between EO and SM in C. compressirostris and C.tshokwe. Many of these genes correspond to myogenic factors, ion channels and pumps, and genes involved in several metabolic pathways. Cross-species analysis has revealed that the electric organ transcriptome is more variable in terms of gene expression levels across species than the skeletal muscle transcriptome. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained indicate that: i) the loss of contractile activity and the decoupling of the excitation-contraction processes are reflected by the down-regulation of the corresponding genes in the electric organ's transcriptome; ii) the metabolic activity of the EO might be specialized towards the production and turn-over of membrane structures; iii) several ion channels are highly expressed in the EO in order to increase excitability; iv) several myogenic factors might be down-regulated by transcription repressors in the EO.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction is heavily implicated in the multifactorial aging process. Aging humans have increased levels of somatic mtDNA mutations that tend to undergo clonal expansion to cause mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in various tissues, such as heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and gut. Genetic mouse models have shown that somatic mtDNA mutations and cell type-specific respiratory chain dysfunction can cause a variety of phenotypes associated with aging and age-related disease. There is thus strong observational and experimental evidence to implicate somatic mtDNA mutations and mosaic respiratory chain dysfunction in the mammalian aging process. The hypothesis that somatic mtDNA mutations are generated by oxidative damage has not been conclusively proven. Emerging data instead suggest that the inherent error rate of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma (Pol gamma) may be responsible for the majority of somatic mtDNA mutations. The roles for mtDNA damage and replication errors in aging need to be further experimentally addressed.

%X BACKGROUND: The assembly of a robust microtubule-based mitotic spindle is a prerequisite for the accurate segregation of chromosomes to progeny. Spindle assembly relies on the concerted action of centrosomes, spindle microtubules, molecular motors, and nonmotor spindle proteins. RESULTS: Here we use an RNA-interference screen of the human centrosome proteome to identify novel regulators of spindle assembly. One such regulator is HAUS, an 8-subunit protein complex that shares homology to Drosophila Augmin. HAUS localizes to interphase centrosomes and to mitotic spindle microtubules, and its disruption induces microtubule-dependent fragmentation of centrosomes along with an increase in centrosome size. HAUS disruption results in the destabilization of kinetochore microtubules and the eventual formation of multipolar spindles. These severe mitotic defects are alleviated by codepletion of NuMA, indicating that both factors regulate opposing activities. HAUS disruption alters NuMA localization, suggesting that mislocalized NuMA activity contributes to the spindle and centrosome defects observed. CONCLUSION: The human Augmin complex (HAUS) is a critical and evolutionary conserved multisubunit protein complex that regulates centrosome and spindle integrity.

%X The centrosome is the main microtubule organization centre of animal cells. It is composed of a centriole pair surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM). Traditionally described as amorphous, the architecture of the PCM is not known, although its intricate mode of assembly alludes to the presence of a functional, hierarchical structure. Here we used subdiffraction imaging to reveal organizational features of the PCM. Interphase PCM components adopt a concentric toroidal distribution of discrete diameter around centrioles. Positional mapping of multiple non-overlapping epitopes revealed that pericentrin (PCNT) is an elongated molecule extending away from the centriole. We find that PCM components occupy separable spatial domains within mitotic PCM that are maintained in the absence of microtubule nucleation complexes and further implicate PCNT and CDK5RAP2 in the organization and assembly of PCM. Globally, this work highlights the role of higher-order PCM organization in the regulation of centrosome assembly and function.

%X Tissue mechanics drive morphogenesis, but how forces are sensed and transmitted to control stem cell fate and self-organization remains unclear. We show that a mechanosensory complex of emerin (Emd), non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) and actin controls gene silencing and chromatin compaction, thereby regulating lineage commitment. Force-driven enrichment of Emd at the outer nuclear membrane of epidermal stem cells leads to defective heterochromatin anchoring to the nuclear lamina and a switch from H3K9me2,3 to H3K27me3 occupancy at constitutive heterochromatin. Emd enrichment is accompanied by the recruitment of NMIIA to promote local actin polymerization that reduces nuclear actin levels, resulting in attenuation of transcription and subsequent accumulation of H3K27me3 at facultative heterochromatin. Perturbing this mechanosensory pathway by deleting NMIIA in mouse epidermis leads to attenuated H3K27me3-mediated silencing and precocious lineage commitment, abrogating morphogenesis. Our results reveal how mechanics integrate nuclear architecture and chromatin organization to control lineage commitment and tissue morphogenesis.

%X FtsH-related AAA proteases are conserved membrane-anchored, ATP-dependent molecular machines, which mediate the processing and turnover of soluble and membrane-embedded proteins in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Homo- and hetero-oligomeric proteolytic complexes exist, which are composed of homologous subunits harboring an ATPase domain of the AAA family and an H41 metallopeptidase domain. Mutations in subunits of mitochondrial m-AAA proteases have been associated with different neurodegenerative disorders in human, raising questions on the functional differences between homo- and hetero-oligomeric AAA proteases. Here, we have analyzed the hetero-oligomeric yeast m-AAA protease composed of homologous Yta10 and Yta12 subunits. We combined genetic and structural approaches to define the molecular determinants for oligomer assembly and to assess functional similarities between Yta10 and Yta12. We demonstrate that replacement of only two amino acid residues within the metallopeptidase domain of Yta12 allows its assembly into homo-oligomeric complexes. To provide a molecular explanation, we determined the 12 A resolution structure of the intact yeast m-AAA protease with its transmembrane domains by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and atomic structure fitting. The full-length m-AAA protease has a bipartite structure and is a hexamer in solution. We found that residues in Yta12, which facilitate homo-oligomerization when mutated, are located at the interface between neighboring protomers in the hexamer ring. Notably, the transmembrane and intermembrane space domains are separated from the main body, creating a passage on the matrix side, which is wide enough to accommodate unfolded but not folded polypeptides. These results suggest a mechanism regarding how proteins are recognized and degraded by m-AAA proteases.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-established cause of sensorineural deafness, but the pathophysiological events are poorly understood. Non-syndromic deafness and predisposition to aminoglycoside-induced deafness can be caused by specific mutations in the 12S rRNA gene of mtDNA and are thus maternally inherited traits. The pathophysiology induced by mtDNA mutations has traditionally been attributed to deficient oxidative phosphorylation, which causes energy crisis with functional impairment of multiple cellular processes. In contrast, it was recently reported that signaling induced by 'hypermethylation' of two conserved adenosines of 12S rRNA in the mitoribosome is of key pathophysiological importance in sensorineural deafness. In support for this concept, it was reported that overexpression of the essential mitochondrial methyltransferase TFB1M in the mouse was sufficient to induce mitoribosomal hypermethylation and deafness. At variance with this model, we show here that 12S rRNA is near fully methylated in vivo in the mouse and thus cannot be further methylated to any significant extent. Furthermore, bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice overexpressing TFB1M have no increase of 12S rRNA methylation levels and hear normally. We thus conclude that therapies directed against mitoribosomal methylation are unlikely to be beneficial to patients with sensorineural hearing loss or other types of mitochondrial disease.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in aging and degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Continuous fission and fusion of mitochondria shapes their morphology and is essential to maintain oxidative phosphorylation. Loss-of-function mutations in PTEN-induced kinase1 (PINK1) or Parkin cause a recessive form of PD and have been linked to altered regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. More specifically, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin has been shown to directly regulate the levels of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and Mfn2, two homologous outer membrane large GTPases that govern mitochondrial fusion, but it is not known whether this is of relevance for disease pathophysiology. Here, we address the importance of Mfn1 and Mfn2 in midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in vivo by characterizing mice with DA neuron-specific knockout of Mfn1 or Mfn2. We find that Mfn1 is dispensable for DA neuron survival and motor function. In contrast, Mfn2 DA neuron-specific knockouts develop a fatal phenotype with reduced weight, locomotor disturbances and death by 7 weeks of age. Mfn2 knockout DA neurons have spherical and enlarged mitochondria with abnormal cristae and impaired respiratory chain function. Parkin does not translocate to these defective mitochondria. Surprisingly, Mfn2 DA neuron-specific knockout mice have normal numbers of midbrain DA neurons, whereas there is a severe loss of DA nerve terminals in the striatum, accompanied by depletion of striatal DA levels. These results show that Mfn2, but not Mfn1, is required for axonal projections of DA neurons in vivo.

%X Modification of proteins with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules is involved in the regulation of almost every biological process. Historically, each conjugation pathway has its unique set of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes that lead to activation and conjugation of their cognate molecules. Here, we present the unexpected finding that under stress conditions, the ubiquitin E1 enzyme Ube1 mediates conjugation of the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome, heat shock and oxidative stress cause a global increase in NEDDylation. Surprisingly, this does not depend on the NEDD8 E1-activating enzyme, but rather on Ube1. A common event in the tested stress conditions is the depletion of "free" ubiquitin. A decrease in "free" ubiquitin levels in the absence of additional stress is sufficient to stimulate NEDDylation through Ube1. Further analysis on the NEDD8 proteome shows that the modified NEDDylated proteins are simultaneously ubiquitinated. Mass spectrometry on the complex proteome under stress reveals the existence of mixed chains between NEDD8 and ubiquitin. We further show that NEDDylation of the p53 tumor suppressor upon stress is mediated mainly through Ube1. Our studies reveal an unprecedented interplay between NEDD8 and ubiquitin pathways operating in diverse cellular stress conditions.

%X Deficiency of thymidine kinase-2 (TK2) has been described in children with early onset fatal skeletal myopathy. TK2 is a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside kinase required for the phosphorylation of deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine and hence is vital for the maintenance of a balanced mitochondrial dNTP pool in post-mitotic tissues. We describe a patient with two novel TK2 mutations, which caused disease onset shortly after birth and death at the age of three months. One mutation (219insCG) generated an early stop codon, thus preventing the synthesis of a functional protein. The second mutation (R130W) resulted in an amino acid substitution, which caused a severe reduction (<3%) of TK2 enzyme activity. These two novel TK2 mutations cause an extremely severe phenotype with overwhelming central nervous system symptoms not commonly seen in patients with TK2-deficiency. We conclude that the severe clinical presentation in this patient was due to a virtual lack of mitochondrial TK2 activity.

%X Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying age-dependent deterioration in beta-cell function. We now demonstrate that age-dependent impairment in insulin release, and thereby glucose homeostasis, is associated with subtle changes in Ca(2+) dynamics in mouse beta-cells. We show that these changes are likely to be accounted for by impaired mitochondrial function and to involve phospholipase C/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca(2+) mobilization from intracellular stores as well as decreased beta-cell Ca(2+) influx over the plasma membrane. We use three mouse models, namely, a premature aging phenotype, a mature aging phenotype, and an aging-resistant phenotype. Premature aging is studied in a genetically modified mouse model with an age-dependent accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations. Mature aging is studied in the C57BL/6 mouse, whereas the 129 mouse represents a model that is more resistant to age-induced deterioration. Our data suggest that aging is associated with a progressive decline in beta-cell mitochondrial function that negatively impacts on the fine tuning of Ca(2+) dynamics. This is conceptually important since it emphasizes that even relatively modest changes in beta-cell signal transduction over time lead to compromised insulin release and a diabetic phenotype.

%X For the identification of proteins from biological samples by mass spectrometry there are two scenarios. Proteins are pre-fractionated in some way or are analysed as a complex mixture (shotgun). Shotgun proteomics recently became more popular, because of technological developments on the mass spectrometer side which now allows the identification of several thousand proteins from a complex biological matrix at one go. However, in many cases it is still useful to separate proteins first in a gel. But not only mass spectrometer technology made progress. Recently, new protocols and techniques which make the analysis of starting material in the low microgram range possible, and also simplify the whole procedure, were developed. In this small review detailed protocols will be described which also allow inexperienced beginners to get good results.

%X The ICP0 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and transactivator required for the efficient switch between latent and lytic infection. As DNA damaging treatments are known to reactivate latent virus, we wished to explore whether ICP0 modulates the cellular response to DNA damage. We report that ICP0 prevents accumulation of repair factors at cellular damage sites, acting between recruitment of the mediator proteins Mdc1 and 53BP1. We identify RNF8 and RNF168, cellular histone ubiquitin ligases responsible for anchoring repair factors at sites of damage, as new targets for ICP0-mediated degradation. By targeting these ligases, ICP0 expression results in loss of ubiquitinated forms of H2A, mobilization of DNA repair proteins and enhanced viral fitness. Our study raises the possibility that the ICP0-mediated control of histone ubiquitination may link DNA repair, relief of transcriptional repression, and activation of latent viral genomes.

%X Summary The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) is a major determinant and indicator of cell fate, but it is not possible to assess small changes in Δψm within cells or in vivo. To overcome this, we developed an approach that utilizes two mitochondria-targeted probes each containing a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) lipophilic cation that drives their accumulation in response to Δψm and the plasma membrane potential (Δψp). One probe contains an azido moiety and the other a cyclooctyne, which react together in a concentration-dependent manner by “click” chemistry to form MitoClick. As the mitochondrial accumulation of both probes depends exponentially on Δψm and Δψp, the rate of MitoClick formation is exquisitely sensitive to small changes in these potentials. MitoClick accumulation can then be quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach enables assessment of subtle changes in membrane potentials within cells and in the mouse heart in vivo.

%X The workshop entitled 'Interventions to Slow Aging in Humans: Are We Ready?' was held in Erice, Italy, on October 8-13, 2013, to bring together leading experts in the biology and genetics of aging and obtain a consensus related to the discovery and development of safe interventions to slow aging and increase healthy lifespan in humans. There was consensus that there is sufficient evidence that aging interventions will delay and prevent disease onset for many chronic conditions of adult and old age. Essential pathways have been identified, and behavioral, dietary, and pharmacologic approaches have emerged. Although many gene targets and drugs were discussed and there was not complete consensus about all interventions, the participants selected a subset of the most promising strategies that could be tested in humans for their effects on healthspan. These were: (i) dietary interventions mimicking chronic dietary restriction (periodic fasting mimicking diets, protein restriction, etc.); (ii) drugs that inhibit the growth hormone/IGF-I axis; (iii) drugs that inhibit the mTOR-S6K pathway; or (iv) drugs that activate AMPK or specific sirtuins. These choices were based in part on consistent evidence for the pro-longevity effects and ability of these interventions to prevent or delay multiple age-related diseases and improve healthspan in simple model organisms and rodents and their potential to be safe and effective in extending human healthspan. The authors of this manuscript were speakers and discussants invited to the workshop. The following summary highlights the major points addressed and the conclusions of the meeting.

%X Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging, with minimal side effects.

%X An essential question in human biology is how cells and tissues differ in gene and protein expression and how these differences delineate specific biological function. Here, we have performed a global analysis of both mRNA and protein levels based on sequence-based transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), SILAC-based mass spectrometry analysis and antibody-based confocal microscopy. The study was performed in three functionally different human cell lines and based on the global analysis, we estimated the fractions of mRNA and protein that are cell specific or expressed at similar/different levels in the cell lines. A highly ubiquitous RNA expression was found with >60% of the gene products detected in all cells. The changes of mRNA and protein levels in the cell lines using SILAC and RNA ratios show high correlations, even though the genome-wide dynamic range is substantially higher for the proteins as compared with the transcripts. Large general differences in abundance for proteins from various functional classes are observed and, in general, the cell-type specific proteins are low abundant and highly enriched for cell-surface proteins. Thus, this study shows a path to characterize the transcriptome and proteome in human cells from different origins.

%X Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma (POLgamma) harbours a 3'-5' exonuclease proofreading activity. Here we demonstrate that this activity is required for the creation of ligatable ends during mtDNA replication. Exonuclease-deficient POLgamma fails to pause on reaching a downstream 5'-end. Instead, the enzyme continues to polymerize into double-stranded DNA, creating an unligatable 5'-flap. Disease-associated mutations can both increase and decrease exonuclease activity and consequently impair DNA ligation. In mice, inactivation of the exonuclease activity causes an increase in mtDNA mutations and premature ageing phenotypes. These mutator mice also contain high levels of truncated, linear fragments of mtDNA. We demonstrate that the formation of these fragments is due to impaired ligation, causing nicks near the origin of heavy-strand DNA replication. In the subsequent round of replication, the nicks lead to double-strand breaks and linear fragment formation.

%X Nuclear receptors are a class of hormone-gated transcription factors found in metazoans that regulate global changes in gene expression when bound to their cognate ligands. Despite species diversification, nuclear receptors function similarly across taxa, having fundamental roles in detecting intrinsic and environmental signals, and subsequently in coordinating transcriptional cascades that direct reproduction, development, metabolism and homeostasis. These endocrine receptors function in vivo in part as molecular switches and timers that regulate transcriptional cascades. Several Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear receptors integrate intrinsic and extrinsic signals to regulate the dauer diapause and longevity, molting, and heterochronic circuits of development, and are comparable to similar in vivo endocrine regulated processes in other animals.

%X Hormone-gated nuclear receptors (NRs) are conserved transcriptional regulators of metabolism, reproduction, and homeostasis. Here we show that C. elegans NHR-8 NR, a homolog of vertebrate liver X and vitamin D receptors, regulates nematode cholesterol balance, fatty acid desaturation, apolipoprotein production, and bile acid metabolism. Loss of nhr-8 results in a deficiency in bile acid-like steroids, called the dafachronic acids, which regulate the related DAF-12/NR, thus controlling entry into the long-lived dauer stage through cholesterol availability. Cholesterol supplementation rescues various nhr-8 phenotypes, including developmental arrest, unsaturated fatty acid deficiency, reduced fertility, and shortened life span. Notably, nhr-8 also interacts with daf-16/FOXO to regulate steady-state cholesterol levels and is synthetically lethal in combination with insulin signaling mutants that promote unregulated growth. Our studies provide important insights into nuclear receptor control of cholesterol balance and metabolism and their impact on development, reproduction, and aging in the context of larger endocrine networks.

%X Small-molecule ligands of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) govern the transcriptional regulation of metazoan development, cell differentiation, and metabolism. However, the physiological ligands of many NHRs remain poorly characterized, primarily due to lack of robust analytical techniques. Using comparative metabolomics, we identified endogenous steroids that act as ligands of the C. elegans NHR, DAF-12, a vitamin D and liver X receptor homolog regulating larval development, fat metabolism, and lifespan. The identified molecules feature unexpected chemical modifications and include only one of two DAF-12 ligands reported earlier, necessitating a revision of previously proposed ligand biosynthetic pathways. We further show that ligand profiles are regulated by a complex enzymatic network, including the Rieske oxygenase DAF-36, the short-chain dehydrogenase DHS-16, and the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSD-1. Our results demonstrate the advantages of comparative metabolomics over traditional candidate-based approaches and provide a blueprint for the identification of ligands for other C. elegans and mammalian NHRs.

%X Integrin linked kinase (ILK) connects the ILK-Pinch-Parvin complex with integrin adhesion sites. Because of the functional relevance of integrin-linked signaling for endothelial cell (EC) biology, we have explored this pathway in Ilk(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiated into ECs and vessel-like structures. We have focused in particular on the mechanistic relevance of ILK-Pinch-Parvin complex-related signaling for EC development and tube formation. Our analysis revealed that the formation of vessel-like structures was strongly reduced in Ilk(-/-) ES cells and that this phenotype could be rescued by re-expression of ILK in ES cells. ECs were MACS sorted from wild-type (WT) and Ilk(-/-) ES cells and functional analysis using intracellular calcium imaging as the read-out yielded a complete lack of vascular endothelial growth factor- and epidermal growth factor-dependent responses. The possibility of a caveolin 1-related defect was investigated by transfecting WT and Ilk(-/-) ECs with a caveolin 1-EGFP fusion protein. Time-lapse microscopy showed that the prominent phenotype is due to altered dynamics of caveolin 1 and to a lack of positioning of caveolin 1 in the vicinity of the plasma membrane and that it is rescued by re-expressing ILK in the Ilk(-/-) ES cells. We also found that the defect is caused by the perturbed organization of microtubules and cortical actin filaments. Thus, ILK is required as a scaffold to allow actin-microtubule interactions and correct positioning of caveolin 1 close to the plasma membrane. This is crucial for signaling compartmentalization in ECs and explains the key role of ILK for EC development and function.

%X BACKGROUND: Hereditary ataxias are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders, where exome sequencing may become an important diagnostic tool to solve clinically or genetically complex cases. METHODS: We describe an Italian family in which three sisters were affected by ataxia with postural/intentional myoclonus and involuntary movements at onset, which persisted during the disease. Oculomotor apraxia was absent. Clinical and genetic data did not allow us to exclude autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance and suggest a disease gene. RESULTS: Exome sequencing identified a homozygous c.6292C > T (p.Arg2098*) mutation in SETX and a heterozygous c.346G > A (p.Gly116Arg) mutation in AFG3L2 shared by all three affected individuals. A fourth sister (II.7) had subclinical myoclonic jerks at proximal upper limbs and perioral district, confirmed by electrophysiology, and carried the p.Gly116Arg change. Three siblings were healthy. Pathogenicity prediction and a yeast-functional assay suggested p.Gly116Arg impaired m-AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) complex function. CONCLUSIONS: Exome sequencing is a powerful tool in identifying disease genes. We identified an atypical form of Ataxia with Oculoapraxia type 2 (AOA2) with myoclonus at onset associated with the c.6292C > T (p.Arg2098*) homozygous mutation. Because the same genotype was described in six cases from a Tunisian family with a typical AOA2 without myoclonus, we speculate this latter feature is associated with a second mutated gene, namely AFG3L2 (p.Gly116Arg variant). We suggest that variant phenotypes may be due to the combined effect of different mutated genes associated to ataxia or related disorders, that will become more apparent as the costs of exome sequencing progressively will reduce, amplifying its diagnostics use, and meanwhile proposing significant challenges in the interpretation of the data.

%X The small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) alter the function of cellular proteins by covalent attachment to lysine side-chains. SUMOs can target themselves for modification so generating SUMO polymers, the functions of which are beginning to be unraveled.The identification and quantitation of SUMO chains is essential for the functional investigation of SUMO polymerization. Classical techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and western blotting, are indirect and often inconclusive methods for the study of SUMO polymers. On the contrary, direct detection is possible with mass spectrometry (MS) by the identification of the SUMO-SUMO branched peptide remnant after proteolytic digestion. In this chapter, we describe a straightforward workflow that incorporates a modified database to efficiently detect SUMO polymers from simple and complex protein samples. In combination with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), this proteomic strategy allows accurate relative quantitation of SUMO polymers from different biological samples.

%X Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a vital tool in modern life science research. In contrast to the popularity of approaches for relative protein quantitation, the widespread use of absolute quantitation has been hampered by inefficient and expensive production of labeled protein standards. To optimize production of isotopically labeled standards, we genetically modified a commonly employed protein expression Escherichia coli strain, BL21 (DE3), to construct an auxotroph for arginine and lysine. This bacterial strain allows low-cost, high-level expression of fully labeled proteins with no conversion of labeled arginine to proline. In combination with a fluorescence-based quantitation of standards and nontargeted LC-MS/MS analysis of unfractionated total cell lysates, this strain was used to determine the copy number of a post-translational modifier, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-2), in HeLa, human sperm, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. By streamlining and improving the generation of labeled standards, this production system increases the breadth of absolute quantitation by mass spectrometry and will facilitate a far wider uptake of this important technique than previously possible.

%X Protein dynamics is regulated by an elaborate interplay between different post-translational modifications. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) are small proteins that are covalently conjugated to target proteins with important functional consequences. One such modifier is SUMO, which mainly modifies nuclear proteins. SUMO contains a unique N-terminal arm not present in ubiquitin and other Ubls, which functions in the formation of SUMO polymers. Here, we unambiguously show that serine 2 of the endogenous SUMO-1 N-terminal protrusion is phosphorylated in vivo using very high mass accuracy mass spectrometry at both the MS and the MS/MS level and complementary fragmentation techniques. Strikingly, we detected the same phosphorylation in yeast, Drosophila and human cells, suggesting an evolutionary conserved function for this modification. The nearly identical human SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 isoforms differ in serine 2; thus, only SUMO-3 could be phosphorylated at this position. Our finding that SUMO can be modified may point to an additional level of complexity through modifying a protein-modifier.

%X Reversible protein modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) is critical for eukaryotic life. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has proven effective at identifying hundreds of potential SUMO target proteins. However, direct identification of SUMO acceptor lysines in complex samples by mass spectrometry is still very challenging. We have developed a generic method for the identification of SUMO acceptor lysines in target proteins. We have identified 103 SUMO-2 acceptor lysines in endogenous target proteins. Of these acceptor lysines, 76 are situated in the SUMOylation consensus site [VILMFPC]KxE. Interestingly, eight sites fit the inverted SUMOylation consensus motif [ED]xK[VILFP]. In addition, we found direct mass spectrometric evidence for crosstalk between SUMOylation and phosphorylation with a preferred spacer between the SUMOylated lysine and the phosphorylated serine of four residues. In 16 proteins we identified a hydrophobic cluster SUMOylation motif (HCSM). SUMO conjugation of RanGAP1 and ZBTB1 via HCSMs is remarkably efficient.

%X The length and precise linkage of polyubiquitin chains is important for their biological activity. Although other ubiquitin-like proteins have the potential to form polymeric chains their identification in vivo is challenging and their functional role is unclear. Vertebrates express three small ubiquitin-like modifiers, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3. Mature SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are nearly identical and contain an internal consensus site for sumoylation that is missing in SUMO-1. Combining state-of-the-art mass spectrometry with an "in vitro to in vivo" strategy for post-translational modifications, we provide direct evidence that SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 form mixed chains in cells via the internal consensus sites for sumoylation in SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. In vitro, the chain length of SUMO polymers could be influenced by changing the relative amounts of SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. The developed methodology is generic and can be adapted for the identification of other sumoylation sites in complex samples.

%X Obesity and resistance to insulin are closely associated with the development of low-grade inflammation. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is linked to obesity-associated inflammation; however, its role in this context remains controversial. Here we found that mice with an inactivated gene encoding the IL-6Ralpha chain of the receptor for IL-6 in myeloid cells (Il6ra(Deltamyel) mice) developed exaggerated deterioration of glucose homeostasis during diet-induced obesity, due to enhanced resistance to insulin. Tissues targeted by insulin showed increased inflammation and a shift in macrophage polarization. IL-6 induced expression of the receptor for IL-4 and augmented the response to IL-4 in macrophages in a cell-autonomous manner. Il6ra(Deltamyel) mice were resistant to IL-4-mediated alternative polarization of macrophages and exhibited enhanced susceptibility to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia. Our results identify signaling via IL-6 as an important determinant of the alternative activation of macrophages and assign an unexpected homeostatic role to IL-6 in limiting inflammation.

%X Summary Altering the redox state of cysteine residues on protein surfaces is an important response to environmental challenges. Although aging and fasting alter many redox processes, the role of cysteine residues is uncertain. To address this, we used a redox proteomic technique, oxidative isotope-coded affinity tags (OxICAT), to assess cysteine-residue redox changes in Drosophila melanogaster during aging and fasting. This approach enabled us to simultaneously identify and quantify the redox state of several hundred cysteine residues in vivo. Cysteine residues within young flies had a bimodal distribution with peaks at ∼10% and ∼85% reversibly oxidized. Surprisingly, these cysteine residues did not become more oxidized with age. In contrast, 24 hr of fasting dramatically oxidized cysteine residues that were reduced under fed conditions while also reducing cysteine residues that were initially oxidized. We conclude that fasting, but not aging, dramatically alters cysteine-residue redox status in D. melanogaster.

%X Prohibitins comprise an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed family of membrane proteins with poorly described functions. Large assemblies of PHB1 and PHB2 subunits are localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria, but various roles in other cellular compartments have also been proposed for both proteins. Here, we used conditional gene targeting of murine Phb2 to define cellular activities of prohibitins. Our experiments restrict the function of prohibitins to mitochondria and identify the processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1, an essential component of the mitochondrial fusion machinery, as the central cellular process controlled by prohibitins. Deletion of Phb2 leads to the selective loss of long isoforms of OPA1. This results in an aberrant cristae morphogenesis and an impaired cellular proliferation and resistance toward apoptosis. Expression of a long OPA1 isoform in PHB2-deficient cells suppresses these defects, identifying impaired OPA1 processing as the primary cellular defect in the absence of prohibitins. Our results therefore assign an essential function for the formation of mitochondrial cristae to prohibitins and suggest a coupling of cell proliferation to mitochondrial morphogenesis.

%X Prohibitins comprise an evolutionary conserved and ubiquitously expressed family of membrane proteins. Various roles in different cellular compartments have been proposed for prohibitin proteins. Recent experiments, however, identify large assemblies of two homologous prohibitin subunits, PHB1 and PHB2, in the inner membrane of mitochondria as the physiologically active structure. Mitochondrial prohibitin complexes control cell proliferation, cristae morphogenesis and the functional integrity of mitochondria. The processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1, a core component of the mitochondrial fusion machinery, has been defined as a key process affected by prohibitins. The molecular mechanism of prohibitin function, however, remained elusive. The ring-like assembly of prohibitins and their sequence similarity with lipid raft-associated SPFH-family members suggests a scaffolding function of prohibitins, which may lead to functional compartmentalization in the inner membrane of mitochondria.

%X Fusion and fission of mitochondria maintain the functional integrity of mitochondria and protect against neurodegeneration, but how mitochondrial dysfunctions trigger neuronal loss remains ill-defined. Prohibitins form large ring complexes in the inner membrane that are composed of PHB1 and PHB2 subunits and are thought to function as membrane scaffolds. In Caenorhabditis elegans, prohibitin genes affect aging by moderating fat metabolism and energy production. Knockdown experiments in mammalian cells link the function of prohibitins to membrane fusion, as they were found to stabilize the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1 (optic atrophy 1), which mediates mitochondrial inner membrane fusion and cristae morphogenesis. Mutations in OPA1 are associated with dominant optic atrophy characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, highlighting the importance of OPA1 function in neurons. Here, we show that neuron-specific inactivation of Phb2 in the mouse forebrain causes extensive neurodegeneration associated with behavioral impairments and cognitive deficiencies. We observe early onset tau hyperphosphorylation and filament formation in the hippocampus, demonstrating a direct link between mitochondrial defects and tau pathology. Loss of PHB2 impairs the stability of OPA1, affects mitochondrial ultrastructure, and induces the perinuclear clustering of mitochondria in hippocampal neurons. A destabilization of the mitochondrial genome and respiratory deficiencies manifest in aged neurons only, while the appearance of mitochondrial morphology defects correlates with tau hyperphosphorylation in the absence of PHB2. These results establish an essential role of prohibitin complexes for neuronal survival in vivo and demonstrate that OPA1 stability, mitochondrial fusion, and the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome in neurons depend on these scaffolding proteins. Moreover, our findings establish prohibitin-deficient mice as a novel genetic model for tau pathologies caused by a dysfunction of mitochondria and raise the possibility that tau pathologies are associated with other neurodegenerative disorders caused by deficiencies in mitochondrial dynamics.

%X Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, acts on hypothalamic neurons located in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus to regulate energy homeostasis. One of the leptin-regulated neuronal subtypes in the ARC are agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons, which are involved in the regulation of food intake and are directly inhibited by leptin. Leptin activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), but the role of Stat3 in the regulation of AgRP neurons is unclear. Here we show that mice expressing a constitutively active version of Stat3 selectively in AgRP neurons are lean and exhibit relative resistance to diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, this phenotype arises from increased locomotor activity in the presence of unaltered AgRP expression. These data demonstrate that Stat3-dependent signaling in AgRP neurons in the ARC controls locomotor activity independently of AgRP regulation.

%X Dietary restriction (DR) can result in lifespan-extension and improved function and health during ageing. Although the impact of DR on lifespan and health has been established in a variety of organisms, most DR experiments are carried out on laboratory strains that have often undergone adaptation to laboratory conditions. The effect of DR on animals recently derived from wild populations is rarely assessed. We measured the DR response of four populations of Drosophila melanogaster within two generations of collection from the wild. All populations responded to DR with an increase in lifespan and a decrease in female fecundity, similarly to a control, laboratory-adapted strain. These effects of DR are thus not a result of adaptation to laboratory conditions, and reflect the characteristics of natural populations.

%X Sleep fragmentation, particularly reduced and interrupted night sleep, impairs the quality of life of older people. Strikingly similar declines in sleep quality are seen during ageing in laboratory animals, including the fruit fly Drosophila. We investigated whether reduced activity of the nutrient- and stress-sensing insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS)/TOR signalling network, which ameliorates ageing in diverse organisms, could rescue the sleep fragmentation of ageing Drosophila. Lowered IIS/TOR network activity improved sleep quality, with increased night sleep and day activity and reduced sleep fragmentation. Reduced TOR activity, even when started for the first time late in life, improved sleep quality. The effects of reduced IIS/TOR network activity on day and night phenotypes were mediated through distinct mechanisms: Day activity was induced by adipokinetic hormone, dFOXO, and enhanced octopaminergic signalling. In contrast, night sleep duration and consolidation were dependent on reduced S6K and dopaminergic signalling. Our findings highlight the importance of different IIS/TOR components as potential therapeutic targets for pharmacological treatment of age-related sleep fragmentation in humans.

%X The 3' end of the rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit contains two extremely highly conserved dimethylated adenines. This modification and the responsible methyltransferases are present in all three domains of life, but its function has remained elusive. We have disrupted the mouse Tfb1m gene encoding a mitochondrial protein homologous to bacterial dimethyltransferases and demonstrate here that loss of TFB1M is embryonic lethal. Disruption of Tfb1m in heart leads to complete loss of adenine dimethylation of the rRNA of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, impaired assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, and abolished mitochondrial translation. In addition, we present biochemical evidence that TFB1M does not activate or repress transcription in the presence of TFB2M. Our results thus show that TFB1M is a nonredundant dimethyltransferase in mammalian mitochondria. In addition, we provide a possible explanation for the universal conservation of adenine dimethylation of rRNA by showing a critical role in ribosome maintenance.

%X Biogenesis of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes requires a concerted maturation of both the small (SSU) and large subunit (LSU). We demonstrate here that the m(5)C methyltransferase NSUN4, which forms a complex with MTERF4, is essential in mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis as mitochondrial translation is abolished in conditional Nsun4 mouse knockouts. Deep sequencing of bisulfite-treated RNA shows that NSUN4 methylates cytosine 911 in 12S rRNA (m5C911) of the SSU. Surprisingly, NSUN4 does not need MTERF4 to generate this modification. Instead, the NSUN4/MTERF4 complex is required to assemble the SSU and LSU to form a monosome. NSUN4 is thus a dual function protein, which on the one hand is needed for 12S rRNA methylation and, on the other hand interacts with MTERF4 to facilitate monosome assembly. The presented data suggest that NSUN4 has a key role in controlling a final step in ribosome biogenesis to ensure that only the mature SSU and LSU are assembled.

%X Replication of the mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is dependent on the minimal replisome, consisting of the heterotrimeric mtDNA polymerase (POLG), the hexameric DNA helicase TWINKLE and the tetrameric single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB). TWINKLE has been shown to unwind DNA during the replication process and many disease-causing mutations have been mapped to its gene. Patients carrying Twinkle mutations develop multiple deletions of mtDNA, deficient respiratory chain function and neuromuscular symptoms. Despite its importance in human disease, it has been unclear whether TWINKLE is the only replicative DNA helicase in mammalian mitochondria. Furthermore, a substantial portion of mtDNA replication events is prematurely terminated at the end of mitochondrial control region (D-loop) and it is unknown whether TWINKLE also has a role in this abortive replication. Here, we present a conditional mouse knockout for Twinkle and demonstrate that TWINKLE is essential for mouse embryonic development and thus is the only replicative DNA helicase in mammalian mitochondria. Conditional knockout of Twinkle results in severe and rapid mtDNA depletion in heart and skeletal muscle. No replication intermediates or deleted mtDNA molecules are observed after Twinkle knockout, suggesting that TWINKLE once loaded is very processive. We also demonstrate that TWINKLE is essential for nascent H-strand synthesis in the D-loop, thus showing that there is no separate DNA helicase responsible for replication of this region. Our data thus suggest that the relative levels of abortive D-loop synthesis versus complete mtDNA replication are regulated and may provide a mechanism to control progression to complete mtDNA replication.

%X The composition of the mitochondrial membrane is important for its architecture and proper function. Mitochondria depend on a tightly regulated supply of phospholipid via intra-mitochondrial synthesis and by direct import from the endoplasmic reticulum. The Ups1/PRELI-like family together with its mitochondrial chaperones (TRIAP1/Mdm35) represent a unique heterodimeric lipid transfer system that is evolutionary conserved from yeast to man. Work presented here provides new atomic resolution insight into the function of a human member of this system. Crystal structures of free TRIAP1 and the TRIAP1-SLMO1 complex reveal how the PRELI domain is chaperoned during import into the intermembrane mitochondrial space. The structural resemblance of PRELI-like domain of SLMO1 with that of mammalian phoshatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) suggest that they share similar lipid transfer mechanisms, in which access to a buried phospholipid-binding cavity is regulated by conformationally adaptable loops.

%X The multiprotein complex Mediator is a coactivator of RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription that is required for the regulated expression of protein-coding genes. Mediator serves as an end point of signaling pathways and regulates Pol II transcription, but the mechanisms it uses are not well understood. Here, we used mass spectrometry and dynamic transcriptome analysis to investigate a functional role of Mediator phosphorylation in gene expression. Affinity purification and mass spectrometry revealed that Mediator from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is phosphorylated at multiple sites of 17 of its 25 subunits. Mediator phosphorylation levels change upon an external stimulus set by exposure of cells to high salt concentrations. Phosphorylated sites in the Mediator tail subunit Med15 are required for suppression of stress-induced changes in gene expression under non-stress conditions. Thus dynamic and differential Mediator phosphorylation contributes to gene regulation in eukaryotic cells.

%X Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2) is a mainly mitochondrial protein that is widely expressed and is highly conserved across evolution. We have previously shown that SLP-2 binds the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and interacts with prohibitin-1 and -2 to form specialized membrane microdomains in the mitochondrial inner membrane, which are associated with optimal mitochondrial respiration. To determine how SLP-2 functions, we performed bioenergetic analysis of primary T cells from T cell-selective Slp-2 knockout mice under conditions that forced energy production to come almost exclusively from oxidative phosphorylation. These cells had a phenotype characterized by increased uncoupled mitochondrial respiration and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Since formation of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes (RCS) may correlate with more efficient electron transfer during oxidative phosphorylation, we hypothesized that the defect in mitochondrial respiration in SLP-2-deficient T cells was due to deficient RCS formation. We found that in the absence of SLP-2, T cells had decreased levels and activities of complex I-III2 and I-III2-IV(1-3) RCS but no defects in assembly of individual respiratory complexes. Impaired RCS formation in SLP-2-deficient T cells correlated with significantly delayed T cell proliferation in response to activation under conditions of limiting glycolysis. Altogether, our findings identify SLP-2 as a key regulator of the formation of RCS in vivo and show that these supercomplexes are required for optimal cell function.

%X - An expanded GGGGCC repeat in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A fundamental question is whether toxicity is driven by the repeat RNA itself and/or by dipeptide repeat proteins generated by repeat-associated, non-ATG translation. To address this question, we developed in vitro and in vivo models to dissect repeat RNA and dipeptide repeat protein toxicity. Expression of pure repeats, but not stop codon–interrupted “RNA-only” repeats in Drosophila caused adult-onset neurodegeneration. Thus, expanded repeats promoted neurodegeneration through dipeptide repeat proteins. Expression of individual dipeptide repeat proteins with a non-GGGGCC RNA sequence revealed that both poly-(glycine-arginine) and poly-(proline-arginine) proteins caused neurodegeneration. These findings are consistent with a dual toxicity mechanism, whereby both arginine-rich proteins and repeat RNA contribute to C9orf72-mediated neurodegeneration.<br>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6201/1192.full.pdf

%X A protein quality control system, consisting of molecular chaperones and proteases, controls the folding status of proteins and mediates the refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins. Ring-forming AAA+ (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) proteins play crucial roles in both processes by co-operating with either peptidases or chaperone systems. Peptidase-associated AAA+ proteins bind substrates and thread them through their axial channel into the attached proteolytic chambers for degradation. In contrast, the AAA+ protein ClpB evolved independently from an interacting peptidase and co-operates with a cognate Hsp70 (heat-shock protein 70) chaperone system to solubilize and refold aggregated proteins. The activity of this bi-chaperone system is crucial for the survival of bacteria, yeast and plants during severe stress conditions. Hsp70 acts at initial stages of the disaggregation process, enabling ClpB to extract single unfolded polypeptides from the aggregate via a threading activity. Although both classes of AAA+ proteins share a common threading activity, it is apparent that their divergent evolution translates into specific mechanisms, reflecting adaptations to their respective functions. The ClpB-specific M-domain (middle domain) represents such an extra feature that verifies ClpB as the central disaggregase in vivo. M-domains act as regulatory devices to control both ClpB ATPase activity and the Hsp70-dependent binding of aggregated proteins to the ClpB pore, thereby coupling the Hsp70 chaperone activity with the ClpB threading motor to ensure efficient protein disaggregation.

%X We previously described diaryl trifluorothiazoline compound 1a (hereafter referred to as fluorizoline) as a first-in-class small molecule that induces p53-independent apoptosis in a wide range of tumor cell lines. Fluorizoline directly binds to prohibitin 1 and 2 (PHBs), two proteins involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, including apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that fluorizoline-induced apoptosis is mediated by PHBs, as cells depleted of these proteins are highly resistant to fluorizoline treatment. In addition, BAX and BAK are necessary for fluorizoline-induced cytotoxic effects, thereby proving that apoptosis occurs through the intrinsic pathway. Expression analysis revealed that fluorizoline induced the upregulation of Noxa and Bim mRNA levels, which was not observed in PHB-depleted MEFs. Finally, Noxa(-/-)/Bim(-/-) MEFs and NOXA-downregulated HeLa cells were resistant to fluorizoline-induced apoptosis. All together, these findings show that fluorizoline requires PHBs to execute the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

%X Stem cells reside in specialized niches that are critical for their function. Quiescent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are confined within the bulge niche, but how the molecular composition of the niche regulates stem cell behaviour is poorly understood. Here we show that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a key regulator of the bulge extracellular matrix microenvironment, thereby governing the activation and maintenance of HFSCs. ILK mediates deposition of inverse laminin (LN)-332 and LN-511 gradients within the basement membrane (BM) wrapping the hair follicles. The precise BM composition tunes activities of Wnt and transforming growth factor-beta pathways and subsequently regulates HFSC activation. Notably, reconstituting an optimal LN microenvironment restores the altered signalling in ILK-deficient cells. Aberrant stem cell activation in ILK-deficient epidermis leads to increased replicative stress, predisposing the tissue to carcinogenesis. Overall, our findings uncover a critical role for the BM niche in regulating stem cell activation and thereby skin homeostasis.

%X Mitochondria are the structures that produce the bulk part of the cellular energy currency ATP, which drives numerous energy requiring processes in the cell. This process involves a series of large enzyme complexes--the respiratory chain--that couples the transfer of electrons to the creation of a concentration gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which drives ATP synthesis. Complex I (or NADH-quinone oxidoreductase) is the largest and by far the most complicated of the respiratory chain enzyme complexes. The molecular mechanism whereby it couples electron transfer to proton extrusion has remained mysterious until very recently. Low-resolution X-ray structures of complex I have, surprisingly, suggested that electron transfer in the hydrophilic arm, protruding into the mitochondrial matrix, causes movement of a coupling rod that influences three putative proton pumps within the hydrophobic arm embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In this Primer, we will briefly introduce the recent progress made in this area and highlight the road ahead that likely will unravel the detailed molecular mechanisms of complex I function.

%X The organization of individual respiratory chain complexes into supercomplexes or respirasomes has attracted great interest because of the implications for cellular energy conversion. Recently, it was reported that commonly used mouse strains harbor a short COX7a2l (SCAFI) gene isoform that supposedly precludes the formation of complex IV-containing supercomplexes. This claim potentially has serious implications for numerous mouse studies addressing important topics in metabolism, including adaptation to space flights. Using several complementary experimental approaches, we show that mice with the short COX7a2l isoform have normal biogenesis and steady-state levels of complex IV-containing supercomplexes and consequently have normal respiratory chain function. Furthermore, we use a mouse knockout of Lrpprc and show that loss of complex IV compromises respirasome formation. We conclude that the presence of the short COX7a2l isoform in the commonly used C57BL/6 mouse strains does not prevent their use in metabolism research.

%X Mitochondria form a dynamic network within the cell as a result of balanced fusion and fission. Despite the established role of mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2) in mitochondrial fusion, only MFN2 has been associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, which suggests that MFN2 is needed to maintain mitochondrial energy metabolism. The molecular basis for the mitochondrial dysfunction encountered in the absence of MFN2 is not understood. Here we show that loss of MFN2 leads to impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced ATP production, and that this defective oxidative phosphorylation process unexpectedly originates from a depletion of the mitochondrial coenzyme Q pool. Our study unravels an unexpected and novel role for MFN2 in maintenance of the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is necessary for mitochondrial coenzyme Q biosynthesis. The reduced respiratory chain function in cells lacking MFN2 can be partially rescued by coenzyme Q10 supplementation, which suggests a possible therapeutic strategy for patients with diseases caused by mutations in the Mfn2 gene.

%X Defects of the oxidative phosphorylation system, in particular of cytochrome-c oxidase (COX, respiratory chain complex IV), are common causes of Leigh syndrome (LS), which is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with severe progressive neurological symptoms that usually present during infancy or early childhood. The COX-deficient form of LS is commonly caused by mutations in genes encoding COX assembly factors, e.g. SURF1, SCO1, SCO2 or COX10. However, other mutations affecting genes that encode proteins not directly involved in COX assembly can also cause LS. The leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing protein (LRPPRC) regulates mRNA stability, polyadenylation and coordinates mitochondrial translation. In humans, mutations in Lrpprc cause the French Canadian type of LS. Despite the finding that LRPPRC deficiency affects the stability of most mitochondrial mRNAs, its pathophysiological effect has mainly been attributed to COX deficiency. Surprisingly, we show here that the impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced ATP production observed in Lrpprc conditional knockout mouse hearts is caused by an ATP synthase deficiency. Furthermore, the appearance of inactive subassembled ATP synthase complexes causes hyperpolarization and increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Our findings shed important new light on the bioenergetic consequences of the loss of LRPPRC in cardiac mitochondria.

%X Parkin, a RING-between-RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with Parkinson's disease, has a wide neuroprotective activity, preventing cell death in various stress paradigms. We identified a stress-protective pathway regulated by parkin that links NF-kappaB signaling and mitochondrial integrity via linear ubiquitination. Under cellular stress, parkin is recruited to the linear ubiquitin assembly complex and increases linear ubiquitination of NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), which is essential for canonical NF-kappaB signaling. As a result, the mitochondrial guanosine triphosphatase OPA1 is transcriptionally upregulated via NF-kappaB-responsive promoter elements for maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and protection from stress-induced cell death. Parkin-induced stress protection is lost in the absence of either NEMO or OPA1, but not in cells defective for the mitophagy pathway. Notably, in parkin-deficient cells linear ubiquitination of NEMO, activation of NF-kappaB, and upregulation of OPA1 are significantly reduced in response to TNF-alpha stimulation, supporting the physiological relevance of parkin in regulating this antiapoptotic pathway.

%X Reactive oxygen species are not only harmful agents that cause oxidative damage in pathologies, they also have important roles as regulatory agents in a range of biological phenomena. The relatively recent development of this more nuanced view presents a challenge to the biomedical research community on how best to assess the significance of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage in biological systems. Considerable progress is being made in addressing these issues, and here we survey some recent developments for those contemplating research in this area.

%X Mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of polymerase gamma (POLG1) are a major cause of human mitochondrial disease. More than 150 different point mutations in the gene have been reported to be disease causing, resulting in a large range of clinical symptoms. Depending on the mutation or combination of mutations, disease onset can occur in early infancy or late in adult life. Here, we describe the use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to detect deletions within POLG1, which could otherwise go undetected by solely sequencing of the gene. We present a case where an entire POLG1 allele is deleted, with a known pathogenic mutation (W748S) on the remaining allele. The deletion was found in a boy with Alpers syndrome, presenting at 18 months of age with slightly retarded motor development, balance problems, and seizures. Administration of valproic acid (VPA) led to rapidly progressive fatal liver failure in our patient, and we would like to highlight the need to carry out complete POLG1 gene analysis before administration of VPA in cases of pediatric seizure disorders of unknown origin. Debut and severity of the disease in this patient was unique when compared to homozygous or heterozygous patients with the W748S mutation, leading to the conclusion that gene dosage plays a role in the clinical phenotype of this disease.

%X Leigh syndrome is a common clinical manifestation in children with mitochondrial disease and other types of inborn errors of metabolism. We characterised clinical symptoms, prognosis, respiratory chain function and performed extensive genetic analysis of 25 Swedish children suffering from Leigh syndrome with the aim to obtain insights into the molecular pathophysiology and to provide a rationale for genetic counselling. We reviewed the clinical history of all patients and used muscle biopsies in order to perform molecular, biochemical and genetic investigations, including sequencing the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (POLGA) gene and the surfeit locus protein 1 (SURF1) gene. Respiratory chain enzyme activity measurements identified five patients with isolated complex I deficiency and five with combined enzyme deficiencies. No patient presented with isolated complex IV deficiency. Seven patients had a decreased ATP production rate. Extensive sequence analysis identified eight patients with pathogenic mtDNA mutations and one patient with mutations in POLGA. Mutations of mtDNA are a common cause of LS and mtDNA analysis should always be included in the diagnosis of LS patients, whereas SURF1 mutations are not a common cause of LS in Sweden. Unexpectedly, age of onset, clinical symptoms and prognosis did not reveal any clear differences in LS patients with mtDNA or nuclear DNA mutations.

%X DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a potent threat to genome integrity. These lesions also contribute to the efficacy of radiotherapy and many cancer chemotherapeutics. DSBs elicit a signalling cascade that modifies the chromatin surrounding the break, first by ATM-dependent phosphorylation and then by RNF8-, RNF168- and BRCA1-dependent regulatory ubiquitination. Here we report that OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is an inhibitor of DSB-induced chromatin ubiquitination. Surprisingly, we found that OTUB1 suppresses RNF168-dependent poly-ubiquitination independently of its catalytic activity. OTUB1 does so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), the cognate E2 enzyme for RNF168. This unusual mode of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis of OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the UBE2D and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the DSB repair defect associated with defective ATM signalling, indicating that pharmacological targeting of the OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.

%X Ulcerative dermatitis (UD) is a severe inflammatory skin disorder with an unknown aetiology. Recently, insulin receptor substrate 1 KO mice were shown to be fully resistant to UD. In this study, we showed that high-fat diet (HFD) feeding significantly increased incidence of UD in wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, as did lithium-mediated inhibition of GSK3-beta, which is a key negative regulator of IRS1. In contrast to WT mice, resistance to UD was fully preserved in HFD-fed Irs1-KO mice. Our results identify IRS1 as a key determinant of UD pathogenesis and establish a direct link between diet composition, obesity-induced inflammation and chronic ulceration.

%X Glucose hypometabolism is a prominent feature of the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disease progression is associated with a reduction in glucose transporters in both neurons and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. However, whether increasing glucose transport into either of these cell types offers therapeutic potential remains unknown. Using an adult-onset Drosophila model of Abeta (amyloid beta) toxicity, we show that genetic overexpression of a glucose transporter, specifically in neurons, rescues lifespan, behavioral phenotypes, and neuronal morphology. This amelioration of Abeta toxicity is associated with a reduction in the protein levels of the unfolded protein response (UPR) negative master regulator Grp78 and an increase in the UPR. We further demonstrate that genetic downregulation of Grp78 activity also protects against Abeta toxicity, confirming a causal effect of its alteration on AD-related pathology. Metformin, a drug that stimulates glucose uptake in cells, mimicked these effects, with a concomitant reduction in Grp78 levels and rescue of the shortened lifespan and climbing defects of Abeta-expressing flies. Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of increased neuronal uptake of glucose against Abeta toxicity and highlight Grp78 as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

%X Age is the main risk factor for the prevalent diseases of developed countries: cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. The ageing process is deleterious for fitness, but can nonetheless evolve as a consequence of the declining force of natural selection at later ages, attributable to extrinsic hazards to survival: ageing can then occur as a side-effect of accumulation of mutations that lower fitness at later ages, or of natural selection in favour of mutations that increase fitness of the young but at the cost of a higher subsequent rate of ageing. Once thought of as an inexorable, complex and lineage-specific process of accumulation of damage, ageing has turned out to be influenced by mechanisms that show strong evolutionary conservation. Lowered activity of the nutrient-sensing insulin/insulin-like growth factor/Target of Rapamycin signalling network can extend healthy lifespan in yeast, multicellular invertebrates, mice and, possibly, humans. Mitochondrial activity can also promote ageing, while genome maintenance and autophagy can protect against it. We discuss the relationship between evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of ageing and disease, and the associated scientific challenges and opportunities.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the commonly occurring age-associated hearing loss (presbyacusis). We have previously generated mtDNA mutator mice with increased levels of somatic mtDNA point mutations causing phenotypes consistent with premature ageing. We have now utilized these mice to investigate whether elevated levels of somatic mtDNA mutations affect the auditory system. The mtDNA mutator mice develop a progressive impairment of hearing (ABR thresholds). Quantitative assessment of hair cell loss in the cochlea did not show any significant difference between the mutator and wild-type mice. The mtDNA mutator mice showed progressive apoptotic cell loss in the spiral ganglion and increased pathology with increasing age in the stria vascularis. The neurons in the cochlear nucleus showed an accelerated progressive degeneration with increasing age in the mutator mice compared to the wild-type mice. Both physiological and histological characterization thus reveals a striking resemblance between the auditory system pathology of mtDNA mutator mice and humans with presbyacusis. Somatic mtDNA mutations accumulate during normal ageing and further studies in humans are now warranted to investigate whether presbyacusis can be linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.

%X Genome integrity is jeopardized each time DNA replication forks stall or collapse. Here we report the identification of a complex composed of MMS22L (C6ORF167) and TONSL (NFKBIL2) that participates in the recovery from replication stress. MMS22L and TONSL are homologous to yeast Mms22 and plant Tonsoku/Brushy1, respectively. MMS22L-TONSL accumulates at regions of ssDNA associated with distressed replication forks or at processed DNA breaks, and its depletion results in high levels of endogenous DNA double-strand breaks caused by an inability to complete DNA synthesis after replication fork collapse. Moreover, cells depleted of MMS22L are highly sensitive to camptothecin, a topoisomerase I poison that impairs DNA replication progression. Finally, MMS22L and TONSL are necessary for the efficient formation of RAD51 foci after DNA damage, and their depletion impairs homologous recombination. These results indicate that MMS22L and TONSL are genome caretakers that stimulate the recombination-dependent repair of stalled or collapsed replication forks.

%X Under harsh environmental conditions, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae undergo arrest and form dauer larvae that can attach to other animals to facilitate dispersal. It has been argued that this phenomenon, called phoresy, represents an intermediate step toward parasitism. Indeed, parasitic nematodes invade their hosts as infective larvae, a stage that shows striking morphological similarities to dauer larvae. Although the molecular regulation of dauer entry in C. elegans involves insulin and TGF-beta signaling, studies of TGF-beta orthologs in parasitic nematodes didn't provide evidence for a common origin of dauer and infective larvae. To identify conserved regulators between Caenorhabditis and parasitic nematodes, we used an evolutionary approach involving Pristionchus pacificus as an intermediate. We show by mutational and pharmacological analysis that Pristionchus and Caenorhabditis share the dafachronic acid-DAF-12 system as the core endocrine module for dauer formation. One dafachronic acid, Delta7-DA, has a conserved role in the mammalian parasite Strongyloides papillosus by controlling entry into the infective stage. Application of Delta7-DA blocks formation of infective larvae and results in free-living animals. Conservation of this small molecule ligand represents a fundamental link between dauer and infective larvae and might provide a general strategy for nematode parasitism.

%X Prohibitin ring complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane regulate cell proliferation as well as the dynamics and function of mitochondria. Although prohibitins are essential in higher eukaryotes, prohibitin-deficient yeast cells are viable and exhibit a reduced replicative life span. Here, we define the genetic interactome of prohibitins in yeast using synthetic genetic arrays, and identify 35 genetic interactors of prohibitins (GEP genes) required for cell survival in the absence of prohibitins. Proteins encoded by these genes include members of a conserved protein family, Ups1 and Gep1, which affect the processing of the dynamin-like GTPase Mgm1 and thereby modulate cristae morphogenesis. We show that Ups1 and Gep1 regulate the levels of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine in mitochondria in a lipid-specific but coordinated manner. Lipid profiling by mass spectrometry of GEP-deficient mitochondria reveals a critical role of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine for survival of prohibitin-deficient cells. We propose that prohibitins control inner membrane organization and integrity by acting as protein and lipid scaffolds.

%X Cardiolipin (CL), a unique dimeric phosphoglycerolipid predominantly present in mitochondrial membranes, has pivotal functions for the cellular energy metabolism, mitochondrial dynamics and the initiation of apoptotic pathways. Perturbations in the mitochondrial CL metabolism cause cardiomyopathy in Barth syndrome. Here, we identify a novel phosphatase in the mitochondrial matrix space, Gep4, and demonstrate that it dephosphorylates phosphatidylglycerolphosphate to generate phosphatidylglycerol, an essential step during CL biosynthesis. Expression of a mitochondrially targeted variant of Escherichia coli phosphatase PgpA restores CL levels in Gep4-deficient cells, indicating functional conservation. A genetic epistasis analysis combined with the identification of intermediates of CL biosynthesis allowed us to integrate Gep4 in the CL-biosynthetic pathway and assign an essential function during early steps of CL synthesis to Tam41, which has previously been shown to be essential for the maintenance of normal CL levels. Our experiments provide the framework for the further dissection of mechanisms that are required for accumulation and maintenance of CL levels in mitochondria.

%X Prohibitins constitute an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed family of membrane proteins that are essential for cell proliferation and development in higher eukaryotes. Roles for prohibitins in cell signaling at the plasma membrane and in transcriptional regulation in the nucleus have been proposed, but pleiotropic defects associated with the loss of prohibitin genes can be largely attributed to a dysfunction of mitochondria. Two closely related proteins, prohibitin-1 (PHB1) and prohibitin-2 (PHB2), form large, multimeric ring complexes in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The absence of prohibitins leads to an increased generation of reactive oxygen species, disorganized mitochondrial nucleoids, abnormal cristae morphology and an increased sensitivity towards stimuli-elicited apoptosis. It has been found that the processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1, which regulates mitochondrial fusion and cristae morphogenesis, is a key process regulated by prohibitins. Furthermore, genetic analyses in yeast have revealed an intimate functional link between prohibitin complexes and the membrane phospholipids cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine. In light of these findings, it is emerging that prohibitin complexes can function as protein and lipid scaffolds that ensure the integrity and functionality of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

%X Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose functional integrity requires a coordinated supply of proteins and phospholipids. Defined functions of specific phospholipids, like the mitochondrial signature lipid cardiolipin, are emerging in diverse processes, ranging from protein biogenesis and energy production to membrane fusion and apoptosis. The accumulation of phospholipids within mitochondria depends on interorganellar lipid transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria as well as intramitochondrial lipid trafficking. The discovery of proteins that regulate mitochondrial membrane lipid composition and of a multiprotein complex tethering ER to mitochondrial membranes has unveiled novel mechanisms of mitochondrial membrane biogenesis.

%X TGFB1 (transforming growth factor beta 1) is a potent cytokine playing a driving role in development, fibrosis and cancer. It is synthesized as prodomain-growth factor complex that requires tethering to LTBP (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein) for efficient secretion into the extracellular space. Upon release, this large latent complex is sequestered by anchorage to extracellular matrix (ECM) networks, from which the mature growth factor needs to be activated in order to reach its receptors and initiate signaling. Here, we uncovered a novel intracellular secretion pathway by which the latent TGFB1 complex reaches the plasma membrane and is released from fibroblasts, the key effector cells during tissue repair, fibrosis and in the tumor stroma. We show that secretion of latent TGFB1, but not of other selected cytokines or of bulk cargo, is regulated by fibroblast-ECM communication through ILK (integrin linked kinase) that restricts RHOA activity by interacting with ARHGAP26/GRAF1. Latent TGFB1 interacts with GORASP2/GRASP55 and is detected inside MAP1LC3-positive autophagosomal intermediates that are secreted by a RAB8A-dependent pathway. Interestingly, TGFB1 secretion is fully abrogated in human and murine fibroblasts and macrophages that lack key components of the autophagic machinery. Our data demonstrate an unconventional secretion mode of TGFB1 adding another level of control of its bioavailability and activity in order to effectively orchestrate cellular programs prone to dysregulation as seen in fibrosis and cancer.

%X In the present work we have critically examined the use of the KCN-titration technique in the study of the control of the cellular respiration by cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the presence of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(mito)) in HepG2 cells. We clearly show that the apparent high inhibition threshold of COX in the presence of maximal Deltapsi(mito) is due to the KCN-induced decrease of Deltapsi(mito) and not to a low control of COX on the mitochondrial respiration. The tight control exerted by COX on the Deltapsi(mito) provides further insights for understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms associated with mitochondrial defects in human neuromuscular degenerative disorders.

%X ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins found in organisms from all kingdoms of life which regulates many important biological functions including DNA repair, chromatin structure, unfolded protein response and apoptosis. Several cellular enzymes, such as macrodomain containing proteins PARG [poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase] and TARG1 [terminal ADP-ribose (ADPr) protein glycohydrolase], reverse protein ADP-ribosylation. In the present study, we show that human Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X)-type motif 16 (hNUDT16) represents a new enzyme class that can process protein ADP-ribosylation in vitro, converting it into ribose-5'-phosphate (R5P) tags covalently attached to the modified proteins. Furthermore, our data show that hNUDT16 enzymatic activity can be used to trim ADP-ribosylation on proteins in order to facilitate analysis of ADP-ribosylation sites on proteins by MS.

%X DNA double-strand break (DSB) signalling and repair is crucial to preserve genomic integrity and maintain cellular homeostasis. p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is an important regulator of the cellular response to DSBs that promotes the end-joining of distal DNA ends, which is induced during V(D)J and class switch recombination as well as during the fusion of deprotected telomeres. New insights have been gained into the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin and how 53BP1 promotes non-homologous end-joining-mediated DSB repair while preventing homologous recombination. From these studies, a model is emerging in which 53BP1 recruitment requires the direct recognition of a DSB-specific histone code and its influence on pathway choice is mediated by mutual antagonism with breast cancer 1 (BRCA1).

%X DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytolethal DNA lesions. In response to DSBs, cells initiate a complex response that minimizes their deleterious impact on cellular and organismal physiology. In this review, we discuss the discovery of a regulatory ubiquitylation system that modifies the chromatin that surrounds DNA lesions. This pathway is under the control of RNF8 and RNF168, two E3 ubiquitin ligases that cooperate with UBC13 to promote the relocalization of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage. RNF8 and RNF168 orchestrate the recruitment of DNA damage response proteins by catalyzing the ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones and the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on damaged chromatin. Finally, we identify some unresolved issues raised by the discovery of this pathway and discuss the implications of DNA damage-induced ubiquitylation in human disease and development.

%X Single DNA lesions such as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can cause cell death or trigger genome rearrangements that have oncogenic potential, and so the pathways that mend and signal DNA damage must be highly sensitive but, at the same time, selective and reversible. When initiated, boundaries must be set to restrict the DSB response to the site of the lesion. The integration of positive and, crucially, negative control points involving post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation is key for building fast, effective responses to DNA damage and for mitigating the impact of DNA lesions on genome integrity.

%X The response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) entails the hierarchical recruitment of proteins orchestrated by ATM-dependent phosphorylation and RNF8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation. As in most ubiquitin-dependent processes, the ordered accumulation of DNA repair factors at the break site relies on ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs). However, how UBDs select their ligands is poorly understood, and therefore we sought to uncover the basis for selectivity in the ubiquitin-dependent DSB response. We show that RNF168, its paralog RNF169, RAD18, and the BRCA1-interacting RAP80 protein accumulate at DSB sites through the use of bipartite modules composed of UBDs juxtaposed to peptide motifs that provide specificity. These sequences, named LR motifs (LRMs), are transferable, and we show that the RNF169 LRM2 binds to nucleosomes, the substrates of RNF168. The LRM-based selection of ligands is a parsimonious means to build a highly discrete ubiquitin-based signaling pathway such as the DNA damage response.

%X A challenge of systems biology is to integrate incomplete knowledge on pathways with existing experimental data sets and relate these to measured phenotypes. Research on ageing often generates such incomplete data, creating difficulties in integrating RNA expression with information about biological processes and the phenotypes of ageing, including longevity. Here, we develop a logic-based method that employs Answer Set Programming, and use it to infer signalling effects of genetic perturbations, based on a model of the insulin signalling pathway. We apply our method to RNA expression data from Drosophila mutants in the insulin pathway that alter lifespan, in a foxo dependent fashion. We use this information to deduce how the pathway influences lifespan in the mutant animals. We also develop a method for inferring the largest common sub-paths within each of our signalling predictions. Our comparisons reveal consistent homeostatic mechanisms across both long- and short-lived mutants. The transcriptional changes observed in each mutation usually provide negative feedback to signalling predicted for that mutation. We also identify an S6K-mediated feedback in two long-lived mutants that suggests a crosstalk between these pathways in mutants of the insulin pathway, in vivo. By formulating the problem as a logic-based theory in a qualitative fashion, we are able to use the efficient search facilities of Answer Set Programming, allowing us to explore larger pathways, combine molecular changes with pathways and phenotype and infer effects on signalling in in vivo, whole-organism, mutants, where direct signalling stimulation assays are difficult to perform. Our methods are available in the web-service NetEffects: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/NetEffects.

%X Regulation of mammalian mtDNA gene expression is critical for altering oxidative phosphorylation capacity in response to physiological demands and disease processes. The basal machinery for initiation of mtDNA transcription has been molecularly defined, but the mechanisms regulating its activity are poorly understood. In this study, we show that MTERF3 is a negative regulator of mtDNA transcription initiation. The MTERF3 gene is essential because homozygous knockout mouse embryos die in midgestation. Tissue-specific inactivation of MTERF3 in the heart causes aberrant mtDNA transcription and severe respiratory chain deficiency. MTERF3 binds the mtDNA promoter region and depletion of MTERF3 increases transcription initiation on both mtDNA strands. This increased transcription initiation leads to decreased expression of critical promoter-distal tRNA genes, which is possibly explained by transcriptional collision on the circular mtDNA molecule. To our knowledge, MTERF3 is the first example of a mitochondrial protein that acts as a specific repressor of mammalian mtDNA transcription initiation in vivo.

%X The small mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is very gene dense and encodes factors critical for oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations of mtDNA cause a variety of human mitochondrial diseases and are also heavily implicated in age-associated disease and aging. There has been considerable progress in our understanding of the role for mtDNA mutations in human pathology during the last two decades, but important mechanisms in mitochondrial genetics remain to be explained at the molecular level. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that most mtDNA mutations may be generated by replication errors and not by accumulated damage.

%X Adipose tissue secretes protein factors that have systemic actions on cardiovascular tissues. Previous studies have shown that ablation of the adipocyte-secreted protein adiponectin leads to endothelial dysfunction, whereas its overexpression promotes wound healing. However, the receptor(s) mediating the protective effects of adiponectin on the vasculature is not known. Here we examined the role of membrane protein T-cadherin, which localizes adiponectin to the vascular endothelium, in the revascularization response to chronic ischemia. T-cadherin-deficient mice were analyzed in a model of hind limb ischemia where blood flow is surgically disrupted in one limb and recovery is monitored over 28 days by laser Doppler perfusion imaging. In this model, T-cadherin-deficient mice phenocopy adiponectin-deficient mice such that both strains display an impaired blood flow recovery compared with wild-type controls. Delivery of exogenous adiponectin rescued the impaired revascularization phenotype in adiponectin-deficient mice but not in T-cadherin-deficient mice. In cultured endothelial cells, T-cadherin deficiency by siRNA knockdown prevented the ability of adiponectin to promote cellular migration and proliferation. These data highlight a previously unrecognized role for T-cadherin in limb revascularization and show that it is essential for mediating the vascular actions of adiponectin.

%X This annual review focuses on invertebrate model organisms, which continue to yield fundamental new insights into mechanisms of aging. This year, the budding yeast has been used to understand how asymmetrical partitioning of cellular constituents at cell division can produce a rejuvenated offspring from an aging parent. Blocking of sensation of carbon dioxide is shown to extend fly lifespan and to mediate the lifespan-shortening effect of sensory exposure to fermenting yeast. A new study of daf-16, the key forkhead transcription factor that mediates extension of lifespan by mutants in the insulin-signalling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrates that expression of tissue-specific isoforms with different patterns of response to upstream signalling mediates the highly pleiotropic effects of the pathway on lifespan and other traits. A new approach to manipulating mitochondrial activity in Drosophila, by introducing the yeast NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, shows promise for understanding the role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in aging. An exciting new study of yeast and mammalian cells implicates deterioration of the nuclear pore, and consequent leakage of cytoplasmic components into the nucleus, as an important cause of aging in postmitotic tissues. Loss of, or damage to, chromosome-associated histones is also implicated in the determination of lifespan in yeast, worms and fruit flies. The relationship between functional aging, susceptibility to aging-related disease and lifespan itself are explored in two studies in C. elegans, the first examining the role of dietary restriction and reduced insulin signalling in cognitive decline and the second profiling aggregation of the proteome during aging. The invertebrates continue to be a power house of discovery for future work in mammals.

Recent work has shown that ageing in diverse animals, including humans, is malleable to specific types of genetic mutation, diet, and drugs that can extend lifespan and improve health during ageing. These findings point to the prospect of broad-spectrum preventive medicine for the diseases of ageing based on intervention in relevant aspects of the ageing process itself.

%X Cell survival depends on essential processes in mitochondria. Various proteases within these organelles regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and ensure the complete degradation of excess or damaged proteins. Many of these proteases are highly conserved and ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells. They can be assigned to three functional classes: processing peptidases, which cleave off mitochondrial targeting sequences of nuclearly encoded proteins and process mitochondrial proteins with regulatory functions; ATP-dependent proteases, which either act as processing peptidases with regulatory functions or as quality-control enzymes degrading non-native polypeptides to peptides; and oligopeptidases, which degrade these peptides and mitochondrial targeting sequences to amino acids. Disturbances of protein degradation within mitochondria cause severe phenotypes in various organisms and can lead to the induction of apoptotic programmes and cell-specific neurodegeneration in mammals. After an overview of the proteolytic system of mitochondria, we will focus on versatile functions of ATP-dependent AAA proteases in the inner membrane. These conserved proteolytic machines conduct protein quality surveillance of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, mediate vectorial protein dislocation from membranes, and, acting as processing enzymes, control ribosome assembly, mitochondrial protein synthesis, and mitochondrial fusion. Implications of these functions for cell-specific axonal degeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia will be discussed.

%X The hydrophobic patch of cyclins interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrates and p27-type Cdk inhibitors. Although this interaction is assumed to contribute to the specificity of different Cdk-Cyclin complexes, its role in specific steps of the cell cycle has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that in Drosophila the mitotic inhibitor Fruhstart (Frs) binds specifically and with high affinity to the hydrophobic patch of cyclins. In contrast to p27-type Cdk inhibitors, Frs does not form a stable interaction with the catalytic centre of Cdk and allows phosphorylation of generic model substrates, such as histone H1. Consistent with a 2.5 times stronger binding to CycA than to CycE in vitro, ectopic expression of frs induces endocycles, in a manner similar to that reported previously for downregulation of CycA or Cdk1. We propose that binding of Frs to cyclins blocks the hydrophobic patch to interfere with Cdk1 substrate recognition.

%X The mitochondrion was originally a free-living prokaryotic organism, which explains the presence of a compact mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in contemporary mammalian cells. The genome encodes for key subunits of the electron transport chain and RNA components needed for mitochondrial translation. Nuclear genes encode the enzyme systems responsible for mtDNA replication and transcription. Several of the key components of these systems are related to proteins replicating and transcribing DNA in bacteriophages. This observation has led to the proposition that some genes required for DNA replication and transcription were acquired together from a phage early in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell, already at the time of the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. Recent years have seen a rapid development in our molecular understanding of these machineries, but many aspects still remain unknown.

%X Broad aspects of Caenorhabditis elegans life history, including larval developmental timing, arrest at the dauer diapause, and longevity, are regulated by the nuclear receptor DAF-12. Endogenous DAF-12 ligands are 3-keto bile acid-like steroids, called dafachronic acids, which rescue larval defects of hormone-deficient mutants, such as daf-9/cytochrome P450 and daf-36/Rieske oxygenase, and activate DAF-12. Here we examined the effect of dafachronic acid on pathways controlling lifespan. Dafachronic acid supplementation shortened the lifespan of long-lived daf-9 mutants and abolished their stress resistance, indicating that the ligand is "proaging" in response to signals from the dauer pathways. However, the ligand extended the lifespan of germ-line ablated daf-9 and daf-36 mutants, showing that it is "antiaging" in the germ-line longevity pathway. Thus, dafachronic acid regulates C. elegans lifespan according to signaling state. These studies provide key evidence that bile acid-like steroids modulate aging in animals.

%X During metazoan development, cells acquire both positional and temporal identities. The Caenorhabditis elegans heterochronic loci are global regulators of larval temporal fates. Most encode conserved transcriptional and translational factors, which affect stage-appropriate programs in various tissues. Here, we describe dre-1, a heterochronic gene, whose mutant phenotypes include precocious terminal differentiation of epidermal stem cells and altered temporal patterning of gonadal outgrowth. Genetic interactions with other heterochronic loci place dre-1 in the larval-to-adult switch. dre-1 encodes a highly conserved F box protein, suggesting a role in an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Accordingly, RNAi knockdown of the C. elegans SKP1-like homolog SKR-1, the cullin CUL-1, and ring finger RBX homologs yielded similar heterochronic phenotypes. DRE-1 and SKR-1 form a complex, as do the human orthologs, hFBXO11 and SKP1, revealing a phyletically ancient interaction. The identification of core components involved in SCF-mediated modification and/or proteolysis suggests an important level of regulation in the heterochronic hierarchy.

%X The energy-dependent proteolysis of cellular proteins is mediated by conserved proteolytic AAA(+) complexes. Two such machines, the m- and i-AAA proteases, are present in the mitochondrial inner membrane. They exert chaperone-like properties and specifically degrade nonnative membrane proteins. However, molecular mechanisms of substrate engagement by AAA proteases remained elusive. Here, we define initial steps of substrate recognition and identify two distinct substrate binding sites in the i-AAA protease subunit Yme1. Misfolded polypeptides are recognized by conserved helices in proteolytic and AAA domains. Structural modeling reveals a lattice-like arrangement of these helices at the surface of hexameric AAA protease ring complexes. While helices within the AAA domain apparently play a general role for substrate binding, the requirement for binding to surface-exposed helices within the proteolytic domain is determined by the folding and membrane association of substrates. Moreover, an assembly factor of cytochrome c oxidase, Cox20, serves as a substrate-specific cofactor during proteolysis and modulates the initial interaction of nonassembled Cox2 with the protease. Our findings therefore reveal the existence of alternative substrate recognition pathways within AAA proteases and shed new light on molecular mechanisms ensuring the specificity of proteolysis by energy-dependent proteases.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), a common age-associated neurodegenerative disease characterized by intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies) and progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system. It has recently been demonstrated that midbrain DA neurons of PD patients and elderly humans contain high levels of somatic mtDNA mutations, which may impair respiratory chain function. However, clinical studies have not established whether the respiratory chain deficiency is a primary abnormality leading to inclusion formation and DA neuron death, or whether generalized metabolic abnormalities within the degenerating DA neurons cause secondary damage to mitochondria. We have used a reverse genetic approach to investigate this question and created conditional knockout mice (termed MitoPark mice), with disruption of the gene for mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in DA neurons. The knockout mice have reduced mtDNA expression and respiratory chain deficiency in midbrain DA neurons, which, in turn, leads to a parkinsonism phenotype with adult onset of slowly progressive impairment of motor function accompanied by formation of intraneuronal inclusions and dopamine nerve cell death. Confocal and electron microscopy show that the inclusions contain both mitochondrial protein and membrane components. These experiments demonstrate that respiratory chain dysfunction in DA neurons may be of pathophysiological importance in PD.

%X The neurotransmitter 5-HT regulates early developmental processes in the CNS. In the present study we followed the embryonic and postnatal development of serotonergic raphe neurons and catecholaminergic target systems in the brain of 5-HT1A receptor knockout (KO) and overexpressing (OE) in comparison with wild-type (WT) mice from embryonic day (E) 12.5 to postnatal day (P) 15.5. Up to P15.5 no differences were apparent in the differentiation and distribution of serotonergic neurons in the raphe area as revealed by the equal number of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe in all three genotypes. However, the establishment of serotonergic projections to the mesencephalic tegmentum and hypothalamus was delayed at E12.5 in KO and OE animals and projections to the cerebral cortex between E16.5 and E18.5 were delayed in OE mice. This delay was only transient and did not occur in other brain areas including septum, hippocampus and striatum. Moreover, OE mice caught up with WT and KO animals postnatally such that at P1.5 serotonergic innervation of the cortex was more extensive in the OE than in KO and WT mice. Tissue levels of 5-HT and of its main metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid as well as 5-HT turnover were considerably higher in brains of OE mice and slightly elevated in KO mice in comparison with the WT, starting at E16.5 through P15.5. The initial differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in the substantia nigra at E12.5 was transiently delayed in KO and OE mice as compared with WT mice, but no abnormalities in noradrenergic development were apparent in later stages. The present data indicate that 5-HT1A receptor deficiency or overexpression is associated with increased 5-HT synthesis and turnover in the early postnatal period. However, they also show that effects of 5-HT1A KO or OE on the structural development of the serotonergic system are at best subtle and transient. They may nonetheless contribute to the establishment of increased or reduced anxiety-like behavior, respectively, in adult mice.

%X The generation of cellular energy depends on the coordinated assembly of nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded proteins into multisubunit respiratory chain complexes in the inner membrane of mitochondria. Here, we describe the identification of a conserved metallopeptidase present in the intermembrane space, termed Atp23, which exerts dual activities during the biogenesis of the F(1)F(O)-ATP synthase. On one hand, Atp23 serves as a processing peptidase and mediates the maturation of the mitochondrial-encoded F(O)-subunit Atp6 after its insertion into the inner membrane. On the other hand and independent of its proteolytic activity, Atp23 promotes the association of mature Atp6 with Atp9 oligomers. This assembly step is thus under the control of two substrate-specific chaperones, Atp10 and Atp23, which act on opposite sides of the inner membrane. Strikingly, both ATP10 and ATP23 were found to genetically interact with prohibitins, which build up large, ring-like assemblies with a proposed scaffolding function in the inner membrane. Our results therefore characterize not only a novel processing peptidase with chaperone activity in the mitochondrial intermembrane space but also link the function of prohibitins to the F(1)F(O)-ATP synthase complex.

%X The m-AAA protease, an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane, controls protein quality and regulates ribosome assembly, thus exerting essential housekeeping functions within mitochondria. Mutations in the m-AAA protease subunit paraplegin cause axonal degeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), but the basis for the unexpected tissue specificity is not understood. Paraplegin assembles with homologous Afg3l2 subunits into hetero-oligomeric complexes which can substitute for yeast m-AAA proteases, demonstrating functional conservation. The function of a third paralogue, Afg3l1 expressed in mouse, is unknown. Here, we analyze the assembly of paraplegin into m-AAA complexes and monitor consequences of paraplegin deficiency in HSP fibroblasts and in a mouse model for HSP. Our findings reveal variability in the assembly of m-AAA proteases in mitochondria in different tissues. Homo-oligomeric Afg3l1 and Afg3l2 complexes and hetero-oligomeric assemblies of both proteins with paraplegin can be formed. Yeast complementation studies demonstrate the proteolytic activity of these assemblies. Paraplegin deficiency in HSP does not result in the loss of m-AAA protease activity in brain mitochondria. Rather, homo-oligomeric Afg3l2 complexes accumulate, and these complexes can substitute for housekeeping functions of paraplegin-containing m-AAA complexes. We therefore propose that the formation of m-AAA proteases with altered substrate specificities leads to axonal degeneration in HSP.

%X Many muscular and neurological disorders are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and are often accompanied by changes in mitochondrial morphology. Mutations in the gene encoding OPA1, a protein required for fusion of mitochondria, are associated with hereditary autosomal dominant optic atrophy type I. Here we show that mitochondrial fragmentation correlates with processing of large isoforms of OPA1 in cybrid cells from a patient with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers syndrome and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts harboring an error-prone mitochondrial mtDNA polymerase gamma. Furthermore, processed OPA1 was observed in heart tissue derived from heart-specific TFAM knock-out mice suffering from mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and in skeletal muscles from patients suffering from mitochondrial myopathies such as myopathy encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential leads to fast induction of proteolytic processing of OPA1 and concomitant fragmentation of mitochondria. Recovery of mitochondrial fusion depended on protein synthesis and was accompanied by resynthesis of large isoforms of OPA1. Fragmentation of mitochondria was prevented by overexpressing OPA1. Taken together, our data indicate that proteolytic processing of OPA1 has a key role in inducing fragmentation of energetically compromised mitochondria. We present the hypothesis that this pathway regulates mitochondrial morphology and serves as an early response to prevent fusion of dysfunctional mitochondria with the functional mitochondrial network.

%X Mitochondria constantly fuse and divide to adapt organellar morphology to the cell's ever-changing physiological conditions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial dynamics. F-box proteins are subunits of both Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases and non-SCF complexes that regulate a large number of cellular processes. Here, we analyzed the roles of two yeast F-box proteins, Mfb1 and Mdm30, in mitochondrial dynamics. Mfb1 is a novel mitochondria-associated F-box protein. Mitochondria in mutants lacking Mfb1 are fusion competent, but they form aberrant aggregates of interconnected tubules. In contrast, mitochondria in mutants lacking Mdm30 are highly fragmented due to a defect in mitochondrial fusion. Fragmented mitochondria are docked but nonfused in Deltamdm30 cells. Mitochondrial fusion is also blocked during sporulation of homozygous diploid mutants lacking Mdm30, leading to a mitochondrial inheritance defect in ascospores. Mfb1 and Mdm30 exert nonredundant functions and likely have different target proteins. Because defects in F-box protein mutants could not be mimicked by depletion of SCF complex and proteasome core subunits, additional yet unknown factors are likely involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. We propose that mitochondria-associated F-box proteins Mfb1 and Mdm30 are key components of a complex machinery that regulates mitochondrial dynamics throughout yeast's entire life cycle.

%X Mitochondrial morphology depends on balanced fusion and fission events. A central component of the mitochondrial fusion apparatus is the conserved GTPase Fzo1 in the outer membrane of mitochondria. Mdm30, an F-box protein required for mitochondrial fusion in vegetatively growing cells, affects the cellular Fzo1 concentration in an unknown manner. We demonstrate that mitochondrial fusion requires a tight control of Fzo1 levels, which is ensured by Fzo1 turnover. Mdm30 binds to Fzo1 and, dependent on its F-box, mediates proteolysis of Fzo1. Unexpectedly, degradation occurs along a novel proteolytic pathway not involving ubiquitylation, Skp1-Cdc53-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, or 26S proteasomes, indicating a novel function of an F-box protein. This contrasts to the ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent turnover of Fzo1 in alpha-factor-arrested yeast cells. Our results therefore reveal not only a critical role of Fzo1 degradation for mitochondrial fusion in vegetatively growing cells but also the existence of two distinct proteolytic pathways for the turnover of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins.

%X A broad range of cellular processes are regulated by proteolytic events. Proteolysis has now also been established to control mitochondrial morphology which results from the balanced action of fusion and fission. Two out of three known core components of the mitochondrial fusion machinery are under proteolytic control. The GTPase Fzo1 in the outer membrane of mitochondria is degraded along two independent proteolytic pathways. One controls mitochondrial fusion in vegetatively growing cells, the other one acts upon mating factor-induced cell cycle arrest. Fusion also depends on proteolytic processing of the GTPase Mgm1 by the rhomboid protease Pcp1 in the inner membrane of mitochondria. Functional links of AAA proteases or other proteolytic components to mitochondrial dynamics are just emerging. This review summarises the current understanding of regulatory roles of proteolytic processes for mitochondrial plasticity.

%X In response to environmental and dietary cues, the C. elegans orphan nuclear receptor, DAF-12, regulates dauer diapause, reproductive development, fat metabolism, and life span. Despite strong evidence for hormonal control, the identification of the DAF-12 ligand has remained elusive. In this work, we identified two distinct 3-keto-cholestenoic acid metabolites of DAF-9, a cytochrome P450 involved in hormone production, that function as ligands for DAF-12. At nanomolar concentrations, these steroidal ligands (called dafachronic acids) bind and transactivate DAF-12 and rescue the hormone deficiency of daf-9 mutants. Interestingly, DAF-9 has a biochemical activity similar to mammalian CYP27A1 catalyzing addition of a terminal acid to the side chain of sterol metabolites. Together, these results define the first steroid hormones in nematodes as ligands for an invertebrate orphan nuclear receptor and demonstrate that steroidal regulation of reproduction, from biology to molecular mechanism, is conserved from worms to humans.

%X Two membrane-bound ATP-dependent AAA proteases conduct protein quality surveillance in the inner membrane of mitochondria and control crucial steps during mitochondrial biogenesis. AAA domains of proteolytic subunits are critical for the recognition of non-native membrane proteins which are extracted from the membrane bilayer for proteolysis. Here, we have analysed the role of the conserved loop motif YVG, which has been localized to the central pore in other hexameric AAA(+) ring complexes, for the degradation of membrane proteins by the i-AAA protease Yme1. Proteolytic activity was found to depend on the presence of hydrophobic amino acid residues at position 354 within the pore loop of Yme1. Mutations affected proteolysis in a substrate-specific manner: whereas the degradation of misfolded membrane proteins was impaired at a post-binding step, folded substrate proteins did not interact with mutant Yme1. This reflects most likely deficiencies in the ATP-dependent unfolding of substrate proteins, since we observed similar effects for ATPase-deficient Yme1 mutants. Our findings therefore suggest an essential function of the central pore loop for the ATP-dependent translocation of membrane proteins into a proteolytic cavity formed by AAA proteases.

%X Peptides generated upon degradation of mitochondrial proteins by various ATP-dependent proteases are continuously released from mitochondria raising the intriguing possibility of a role of these peptides in interorganellar communication. Here, we have determined genome-wide transcript profiles of mutant yeast cells defective in mitochondrial peptide export. Deletion of YME1, coding for the i-AAA protease in the inner membrane, abolished peptide generation in the intermembrane space and led to the induction of nuclear genes with functions in mitochondrial gene expression and the biogenesis of the respiratory chain. On the other hand, deletion of MDL1, coding for an ABC-transporter involved in peptide export from the matrix space, only had minor effects on nuclear gene expression. It strengthened, however, the response in Deltayme1 cells suggesting a link between mitochondrial peptide export and nuclear gene expression. The response in Yme1-deficient cells depended on respiratory growth and was not observed in fermenting yeast cells. Inhibition of the F1FO-ATP synthase induced Deltayme1 responsive genes whereas inhibition of the respiratory chain or dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential resulted in their repression. These findings suggest the existence of a novel mitochondria-to-nucleus signalling pathway in respiring cells which allows the re-adjustment of the biogenesis of the respiratory chain in response to an altered activity of the F1FO-ATP synthase.

%X Together with impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, elevated hepatic gluconeogenesis is largely responsible for the hyperglycemic phenotype in type II diabetic patients. Intracellular glucocorticoid and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A-dependent signaling pathways contribute to aberrant hepatic glucose production through the induction of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. Here we show that the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is required for cAMP-mediated activation of rate-limiting gluconeogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32) and glucose-6-phosphatase genes. Mutational analysis showed that CARM1 mediates its effect via the cAMP-responsive element within the PEPCK promoter, which is identified here as a CARM1 target in vivo. In hepatocytes, endogenous CARM1 physically interacts with cAMP-responsive element binding factor CREB and is recruited to the PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase promoters in a cAMP-dependent manner associated with increased promoter methylation. CARM1 might, therefore, represent a critical component of cAMP-dependent glucose metabolism in the liver.

%X An extensive body of evidence links inositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) to the nucleus and the main isoform located in the nucleus is PLCbeta(1). Constitutive overexpression of nuclear PLCbeta(1) has been previously shown to inhibit Friend erythroleukemia cells differentiation and to induce cell cycle progression targeting cyclin D3. The aim of this study was to identify new proteins regulated by PLCbeta(1) overexpression, given the role exerted by its signaling in the nucleus during cell growth and differentiation. To identify novel downstream effectors of nuclear PLCbeta(1)-dependent signaling in Friend erythroleukemia cells, we performed the high-resolution 2-DE-based proteomic analysis. Using a proteomic approach we found that SRp20, a member of the highly conserved SR family of splicing regulators, was down-regulated in cells overexpressing nuclear PLCbeta(1) as compared with wild-type cells. Reduction in SRp20 was confirmed by 2-D Western blotting. Moreover, we have shown that nuclear PLCbeta(1) is bound to the SRp20 splicing factor. Indeed, by immunoprecipitation and subcellular fractioning, we have demonstrated that endogenous PLCbeta(1) and SRp20 physically interact in the nucleus. Here we show the existence of a PLCbeta(1)-specific target, the splicing factor SRp20, whose expression is specifically down-regulated by the nuclear signaling evoked by PLCbeta(1).

%X Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4alpha), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, binds DNA exclusively as a homodimer. Dimerization controls important aspects of receptor function, such as DNA binding, protein stability, ligand binding and interaction with coactivators. Crystallographic data of the HNF-4alpha ligand-binding domain (LBD) demonstrated that the homodimer interface is composed of residues in helices 7, 9 and 10 with intermolecular salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions contributing to the stability of the interface. To investigate the importance of the proposed ionic interactions for HNF-4alpha dimerization, interactions critical for formation of the LBD homodimer interface were disrupted by introducing point mutations in residues D261N (H7), E269Q (H7), Q307L (H9), D312N (H9) and Q336L (H10). Mutants were analysed for transactivation, coactivator interaction, DNA binding and dimerization. EMSA analysis showed that the mutants are able to bind DNA as dimers and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed dimerization in solution. Furthermore, the mutations do not compromise HNF-4alpha activity and are responsive to PPAR-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1). Finally, residue R324, located in the H9/H10 loop, which was suspected to be involved in dimer stabilization via an ionic interaction with residue E276, was studied. In contrast to the conservative substitution R324H the mutation R324L abolishes HNF-4alpha transcriptional activity and coactivator recruitment, revealing that the nature of substitution may play an important role in HNF-4alpha function.

%X AAA proteases comprise a conserved family of membrane bound ATP-dependent proteases that ensures the quality control of mitochondrial inner-membrane proteins. Inactivation of AAA proteases causes pleiotropic phenotypes in various organisms, including respiratory deficiencies, mitochondrial morphology defects, and axonal degeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). The molecular basis of these defects, however, remained unclear. Here, we describe a regulatory role of an AAA protease for mitochondrial protein synthesis in yeast. The mitochondrial ribosomal protein MrpL32 is processed by the m-AAA protease, allowing its association with preassembled ribosomal particles and completion of ribosome assembly in close proximity to the inner membrane. Maturation of MrpL32 and mitochondrial protein synthesis are also impaired in a HSP mouse model lacking the m-AAA protease subunit paraplegin, demonstrating functional conservation. Our findings therefore rationalize mitochondrial defects associated with m-AAA protease mutants in yeast and shed new light on the mechanism of axonal degeneration in HSP.

%X In this report, we demonstrate that C. elegans mab-2 mutants have defects in the development of a male-specific sense organ because of a failure in the proliferation of the stem cell-like lateral hypodermal (seam) cells. We show, by positional cloning, that mab-2 encodes RNT-1, the only C. elegans member of the Runx family of transcriptional regulators, which are postulated to act both as oncogenes and tumour suppressors in mammalian cells. Importantly, we find that rnt-1 is a rate-limiting regulator of seam cell proliferation in C. elegans, as overexpression of rnt-1 at particular developmental stages is capable of driving extra cell divisions, leading to seam cell hyperplasia. Loss of rnt-1 is correlated with upregulation of cki-1, a CDK inhibitor. Deregulated expression of Runx genes in humans is associated with various cancers, particularly leukaemias, suggesting a conserved role for Runx genes in controlling cell proliferation during development, especially in stem cell lineages. C. elegans is therefore an important model system for studying the biology, and oncogenic potential, of Runx genes.

%X The human mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) is involved in the regulation of transcription of the mitochondrial genome. Similarity searches and phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that mTERF is a member of large and complex protein family (the MTERF family) shared amongst metazoans and plants. Interestingly, we identify three novel MTERF genes in vertebrates, which all encode proteins with predicted mitochondrial localization. Members of the MTERF family have so far not been detected in fungi, supporting the notion that mitochondrial transcription regulation may have evolved separately in yeast and animal cells.

%X In C. elegans, dauer pheromone is an indicator of population density and influences pathways that regulate metabolism, development, and aging. In a recent publication in Nature, Paik and coworkers (Jeong at al., 2005) show the purified substance to be a pyran ring conjugated to heptanoic acid, setting the stage for dissecting downstream signaling pathways.

%X The objective of this study was to investigate clinical, biochemical, and genetic features in 7 probands (a total of 11 patients) with nicotine-amide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase (complex I) deficiency. We screened the mitochondrial DNA for mutations and found pathogenic mutations in complex I genes (mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit (MTND) genes) in three probands. The 10191T>C mutation in MTND3 and the 14487T>C mutation in MTND6 were present in two probands with Leigh's-like and Leigh's syndrome, respectively. Four siblings with a syndrome consisting of encephalomyopathy with hearing impairment, optic nerve atrophy, and cardiac involvement had the 11778G>A mutation in MTND4, previously associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. These findings demonstrate that mutations in MTND genes are relatively frequent in patients with complex I deficiency. Biochemical measurements of respiratory chain function in muscle mitochondria showed that all patients had a moderate decrease of the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production rate. Interestingly, the complex I deficiency caused secondary metabolic alterations with decreased oxaloacetate-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) and excretion of Krebs cycle intermediates in the urine. Our results thus suggest that altered regulation of metabolism may play an important role in the pathogenesis of complex I deficiency.

%X Mitochondria harbor a conserved proteolytic system that mediates the complete degradation of organellar proteins. ATP-dependent proteases, like a Lon protease in the matrix space and m- and i-AAA proteases in the inner membrane, degrade malfolded proteins within mitochondria and thereby protect the cell against mitochondrial damage. Proteolytic breakdown products include peptides and free amino acids, which are constantly released from mitochondria. It remained unclear, however, whether the turnover of malfolded proteins involves only ATP-dependent proteases or also oligopeptidases within mitochondria. Here we describe the identification of Mop112, a novel metallopeptidase of the pitrilysin family M16 localized in the intermembrane space of yeast mitochondria. This peptidase exerts important functions for the maintenance of the respiratory competence of the cells that overlap with the i-AAA protease. Deletion of MOP112 did not affect the stability of misfolded proteins in mitochondria, but resulted in an increased release from the organelle of peptides, generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins. We find that the previously described metallopeptidase saccharolysin (or Prd1) exerts a similar function in the intermembrane space. The identification of peptides released from peptidase-deficient mitochondria by mass spectrometry indicates a dual function of Mop112 and saccharolysin: they degrade peptides generated upon proteolysis of proteins both in the intermembrane and matrix space and presequence peptides cleaved off by specific processing peptidases in both compartments. These results suggest that the turnover of mitochondrial proteins is mediated by the sequential action of ATP-dependent proteases and oligopeptidases, some of them localized in the intermembrane space.

%X Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) is a transcription factor of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that is constitutively active without the addition of exogenous ligand. Crystallographic analysis of the HNF-4alpha and HNF-4gamma ligand binding domains (LBDs) demonstrated the presence of endogenous ligands that may act as structural cofactors for HNF-4. It was also proposed by crystallographic studies that a combination of ligand and coactivator might be required to lock the receptor in its active state. We previously showed that mutations in amino acid residues Ser-181 and Met-182 in H3, Leu-219 and Leu-220 and Arg-226 in H5, Ileu-338 in H10, and Ileu-346 in H11, which line the LBD pocket in HNF-4alpha and come in contact with the ligand, impair its transactivation potential. In the present study, physical and functional interaction assays were utilized with two different coactivators, PGC-1 and SRC-3, to address the role of coactivators in HNF-4 function. We show that the integrity of the hinge (D) domain of HNF-4alpha and the activation function (AF)-2 activation domain region are critical for coactivation. Surprisingly, a different mode of coactivation is observed among the LBD point mutants that lack transcriptional activity. In particular, coactivation is maintained in mutants Ser-181, Arg-226, and Ile-346 but is abolished in mutants Met-182, Leu-219, and Ile-338. Physical interactions confirm this pattern of activation, implying that distinct amino acid residues may be involved in coactivator and ligand interactions, although some residues may be critical for both functions. Our results provide evidence and expand predictions based on the crystallographic data as to the role of coactivators in HNF-4alpha constitutive transcriptional activity.

%X Initiation of transcription at mitochondrial promoters in mammalian cells requires the simultaneous presence of a monomeric mitochondrial RNA polymerase, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and either transcription factor B1 or B2. We here review recent progress in our understanding of how these basal factors cooperate in the initiation and regulation of mitochondrial transcription. We describe the evolutionary origin of individual transcription factors and discuss how these phylogenetic relationships may facilitate a molecular understanding of the mitochondrial transcription machinery.

%X Conserved ATP-dependent proteases ensure the quality control of mitochondrial proteins and control essential steps in mitochondrial biogenesis. Recent studies demonstrated that non-assembled mitochondrially encoded proteins are degraded to peptides and amino acids that are released from mitochondria. Here, we have characterized peptides extruded from mitochondria by mass spectrometry and identified 270 peptides that are exported in an ATP- and temperature-dependent manner. The peptides originate from 51 mitochondrially and nuclearly encoded proteins localized mainly in the matrix and inner membrane, indicating that peptides generated by the activity of all known mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteases can be released from the organelle. Pulse-labeling experiments in logarithmically growing yeast cells revealed that approximately 6-12% of preexisting and newly imported proteins is degraded and contribute to this peptide pool. Under respiring conditions, we observed an increased proteolysis of newly imported proteins that suggests a higher turnover rate of respiratory chain components and thereby rationalizes the predominant appearance of representatives of this functional class in the detected peptide pool. These results demonstrated a constant efflux of peptides from mitochondria and provided new insight into the stability of the mitochondrial proteome and the efficiency of mitochondrial biogenesis.

%X Initiation of transcription in mammalian mitochondria depends on three proteins: mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and mitochondrial transcription factor B2 (TFB2M). We show here that the recombinant mouse and human transcription machineries are unable to initiate transcription in vitro from the heterologous light-strand promoter (LSP) of mitochondrial DNA. This species specificity is dependent on the interaction of TFAM and POLRMT with specific distal and proximal promoter elements. A sequence element localized from position -1 to -2 relative to the transcription start site in LSP functionally interacts with POLRMT. The POLRMT/TFB2M heterodimer is unable to interact with promoter elements and initiate even abortive transcription in the absence of TFAM. TFAM is thus an integral part of the mammalian transcription machinery, and we propose that TFAM induces a structural change of the promoter that is required for POLRMT-dependent promoter recognition.

%X A functional respiratory chain is dependent on protein components encoded by both mtDNA and nuclear DNA. Isolated cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is often caused by mutations in nuclear genes regulating the assembly of the 13 protein subunits of this complex. The accompanying paper by Zeman and co-workers reports that mutations in SCO2 are common in infantile COX deficiency and are associated with a very poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Molecular diagnosis is often feasible in patients with COX deficiency and particular attention should be paid to mutations in COX assembly genes.

%X Environmental cues transduced by an endocrine network converge on Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear receptor DAF-12 to mediate arrest at dauer diapause or continuous larval development. In adults, DAF-12 selects long-lived or short-lived modes. How these organismal choices are molecularly specified is unknown. Here we show that coregulator DIN-1 and DAF-12 physically and genetically interact to instruct organismal fates. Homologous to human corepressor SHARP, DIN-1 comes in long (L) and short (S) isoforms, which are nuclear localized but have distinct functions. DIN-1L has embryonic and larval developmental roles. DIN-1S, along with DAF-12, regulates lipid metabolism, larval stage-specific programs, diapause, and longevity. Epistasis experiments reveal that din-1S acts in the dauer pathways downstream of lipophilic hormone, insulin/IGF, and TGFbeta signaling, the same point as daf-12. We propose that the DIN-1S/DAF-12 complex serves as a molecular switch that implements slow life history alternatives in response to diminished hormonal signals.

%X Aging is often described as an extremely complex process affecting all of the vital parameters of an individual. In this article, we review how understanding of aging evolved from the first analyses of population survival to the identification of the molecular mechanisms regulating life span. Abundant evidence implicates mitochondria in aging and we focus on the three main components of the mitochondrial theory of aging: (1) increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, (2) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage accumulation, and (3) progressive respiratory chain dysfunction. Experimental evidence shows a relationship between respiratory chain dysfunction, ROS damage, and aging in most of the model organisms. However, involvement of the mtDNA mutations in the aging process is still debated. We recently created a mutant mouse strain with increased levels of somatic mtDNA mutations causing a progressive respiratory chain deficiency and premature aging. These mice demonstrate the fundamental importance of the accumulation of mtDNA alterations in aging. We present here an integrative model where aging is provoked by a single primary event leading to a variety of effects and secondary causes.

%X The half-ABC transporter Mdl1 is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria and mediates the export of peptides generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins. The physiological role of the peptides released from mitochondria is currently not understood. Here, we have analyzed the oligomeric state of Mdl1 in the inner membrane and demonstrate nucleotide-dependent binding to the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase. Mdl1 forms homo-oligomeric, presumably dimeric complexes in the presence of ATP, but was found in association with the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase at low ATP levels. Mdl1 binds membrane-embedded parts of the ATP synthase complex after the assembly of the F(1) and F(0) moieties. Although independent of Mdl1 activity, complex formation is impaired upon inhibition of the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase with oligomycin or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. These results are consistent with an activation of Mdl1 upon dissociation from the ATP synthase and suggest a link of peptide export from mitochondria to the activity of the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase and the cellular energy metabolism.

%X To gain insight into the cellular and molecular cues that promote neurovascular co-patterning at the earliest stages of human embryogenesis, we developed a human embryonic stem cell model to mimic the developing epiblast. Contact of ectoderm-derived neural cells with mesoderm-derived vasculature is initiated via the neural crest (NC), not the neural tube (NT). Neurovascular co-patterning then ensues with specification of NC toward an autonomic fate requiring vascular endothelial cell (EC)-secreted nitric oxide (NO) and direct contact with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) via T-cadherin-mediated homotypic interactions. Once a neurovascular template has been established, NT-derived central neurons then align themselves with the vasculature. Our findings reveal that, in early human development, the autonomic nervous system forms in response to distinct molecular cues from VSMCs and ECs, providing a model for how other developing lineages might coordinate their co-patterning.

%X A remarkable discovery of recent years is that, despite the complexity of ageing, simple genetic interventions can increase lifespan and improve health during ageing in laboratory animals. The pathways involved have often proved to sense nutrients and to match costly activities of organisms, such as growth, metabolism and reproduction, to nutrient status. For instance, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor and Target of Rapamycin signalling network has proved to play a function in ageing, from yeast to mammals, seemingly including humans. In the fruit fly Drosophila, altered activity of several components of this network can increase lifespan and improve locomotor and cardiac function during ageing. The fly brain, fat body (equivalent of mammalian liver and white adipose tissue) and the germ line are important in determination of lifespan, with considerable communication between different tissues. Cellular detoxification pathways, increased autophagy and altered protein synthesis have all been implicated in increased lifespan from reduced IIS/TOR activity, with the role of defence against oxidative stress unresolved. Reduced IIS/TOR signalling can alter or block the response of lifespan to dietary restriction. Reduced IIS can act acutely to lower death rate, implying that it may ameliorate the effects of ageing-related damage, rather than preventing it.

%X FLT3 is the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with internal tandem duplications (ITDs) accounting for up to 30% of its mutations. To analyze the impact of individual ITDs on the expression profile of immature myeloid cells, we have established 32D cell lines expressing nine different FLT3/ITDs isolated from AML patients and subjected them to whole genome expression profiling and 2DE/LC/MS proteomics. Our data indicate that in comparison to the controls, FLT3/ITD-positive 32D cells exhibit less mature expression profiles resembling early hematopoietic progenitors. Moreover, our results suggest that there exist biological differences among individual ITD variants. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

%X The mammalian MTERF family of proteins has four members, named MTERF1 to MTERF4, which were identified in homology searches using the mitochondrial transcription termination factor, mTERF (here denoted MTERF1) as query. MTERF1 and MTERF3 are known to participate in the control of mitochondrial DNA transcription, but the function of the other two proteins is not known. We here investigate the structure and function of MTERF2. Protein import experiments using isolated organelles confirm that MTERF2 is a mitochondrial protein. Edman degradation of MTERF2 isolated from stably transfected HeLa cells demonstrates that mature MTERF2 lacks a targeting peptide (amino acids 1-35) present in the precursor form of the protein. MTERF2 is a monomer in isolation and displays a non sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. In vivo quantification experiments demonstrate that MTERF2 is relatively abundant, with one monomer present per approximately 265 bp of mtDNA. In comparison, the mtDNA packaging factor TFAM is present at a ratio of one molecule per approximately 10-12 bp of mtDNA. Using formaldehyde cross-linking we demonstrate that MTERF2 is present in nucleoids, and therefore must be located in close proximity to mtDNA. Taken together, our work provides a basic biochemical characterization of MTERF2, paving the way for future functional studies.

%X Recent information has revealed the functional diversity and importance of mitochondria in many cellular processes including orchestrating the innate immune response. Intriguingly, several infectious agents, such as Toxoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydia, have been reported to grow within vacuoles surrounded by host mitochondria. Although many hypotheses have been proposed for the existence of host mitochondrial association (HMA), the causes and biological consequences of HMA have remained unanswered. Here we show that HMA is present in type I and III strains of Toxoplasma but missing in type II strains, both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of F1 progeny from a type IIxIII cross revealed that HMA is a Mendelian trait that we could map. We use bioinformatics to select potential candidates and experimentally identify the polymorphic parasite protein involved, mitochondrial association factor 1 (MAF1). We show that introducing the type I (HMA+) MAF1 allele into type II (HMA-) parasites results in conversion to HMA+ and deletion of MAF1 in type I parasites results in a loss of HMA. We observe that the loss and gain of HMA are associated with alterations in the transcription of host cell immune genes and the in vivo cytokine response during murine infection. Lastly, we use exogenous expression of MAF1 to show that it binds host mitochondria and thus MAF1 is the parasite protein directly responsible for HMA. Our findings suggest that association with host mitochondria may represent a novel means by which Toxoplasma tachyzoites manipulate the host. The existence of naturally occurring HMA+ and HMA- strains of Toxoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydia indicates the existence of evolutionary niches where HMA is either advantageous or disadvantageous, likely reflecting tradeoffs in metabolism, immune regulation, and other functions of mitochondria.

%X Previous work has proposed rhoptry protein 2 (ROP2) as the physical link that tethers host mitochondria to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) surrounding the intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. A recent analysis of the ROP2 structure, however, raised questions about this model. To determine whether ROP2 is necessary, we created a parasite line that lacks the entire ROP2 locus consisting of the three closely related genes, ROP2a, ROP2b and ROP8. We show that this knockout mutant retains the ability to recruit host mitochondria in a manner that is indistinguishable from the parental strain, re-opening the question of which molecules mediate this association.

%X In North America (NA) and Europe, the majority of toxoplasmosis cases are benign and generally asymptomatic, whereas in South America (SA) toxoplasmosis is associated with much more severe symptoms in adults and congenitally infected children. The reasons for these differences remain unknown; currently, there is little information from patients in either region on how the immune system responds to infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Here, we report the relative abundance of 51 serum cytokines from acute and chronic toxoplasmosis cohorts of pregnant women from the United States, where approximately one-half of clinical isolates are Type II, and Colombia, where clinical isolates are generally "atypical" or Type I-like strains. Surprisingly, the results showed notably lower levels of 23 cytokines in acutely infected patients from the United States, relative to uninfected US controls. In acutely infected Colombian patients, however, only 8 cytokine levels differed detectably with 4 being lower and 4 higher relative to uninfected controls. Strikingly, there were also differences in the cytokine profiles of the chronically infected patients relative to uninfected controls in the US cohort. Hence, Toxoplasma appears to specifically impact levels of circulating cytokines, and our results may partly explain region-specific differences in the clinical spectrum of toxoplasmosis.

%X Permanent residency in the eukaryotic cell pressured the prokaryotic mitochondrial ancestor to strategize for intracellular living. Mitochondria are able to autonomously integrate and respond to cellular cues and demands by remodeling their morphology. These processes define mitochondrial dynamics and inextricably link the fate of the mitochondrion and that of the host eukaryote, as exemplified by the human diseases that result from mutations in mitochondrial dynamics proteins. In this review, we delineate the architecture of mitochondria and define the mechanisms by which they modify their shape. Key players in these mechanisms are discussed, along with their role in manipulating mitochondrial morphology during cellular action and development. Throughout, we highlight the evolutionary context in which mitochondrial dynamics emerged and consider unanswered questions whose dissection might lead to mitochondrial morphology-based therapies.

%X We report an early onset spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome in two brothers of a consanguineous family characterized clinically by lower extremity spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, ptosis, oculomotor apraxia, dystonia, cerebellar atrophy, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.1847G>A; p.Y616C) in AFG3L2, encoding a subunit of an m-AAA protease. m-AAA proteases reside in the mitochondrial inner membrane and are responsible for removal of damaged or misfolded proteins and proteolytic activation of essential mitochondrial proteins. AFG3L2 forms either a homo-oligomeric isoenzyme or a hetero-oligomeric complex with paraplegin, a homologous protein mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7 (SPG7). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in AFG3L2 cause autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28), a disorder whose phenotype is strikingly different from that of our patients. As defined in yeast complementation assays, the AFG3L2(Y616C) gene product is a hypomorphic variant that exhibited oligomerization defects in yeast as well as in patient fibroblasts. Specifically, the formation of AFG3L2(Y616C) complexes was impaired, both with itself and to a greater extent with paraplegin. This produced an early-onset clinical syndrome that combines the severe phenotypes of SPG7 and SCA28, in additional to other "mitochondrial" features such as oculomotor apraxia, extrapyramidal dysfunction, and myoclonic epilepsy. These findings expand the phenotype associated with AFG3L2 mutations and suggest that AFG3L2-related disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spastic ataxias.

%X A critical requirement for research using model organisms is a well-defined and consistent diet. There is currently no complete chemically defined (holidic) diet available for Drosophila melanogaster. We describe a holidic medium that is equal in performance to an oligidic diet optimized for adult fecundity and lifespan. This holidic diet supports development over multiple generations but at a reduced rate. Over 7 years of experiments, the holidic diet yielded more consistent experimental outcomes than did oligidic food for egg laying by females. Nutrients and drugs were more available to flies in holidic medium and, similar to dietary restriction on oligidic food, amino acid dilution increased fly lifespan. We used this holidic medium to investigate amino acid-specific effects on food-choice behavior and report that folic acid from the microbiota is sufficient for Drosophila development.

%X The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster offers a host of advantages for studying the biology of aging: a well-understood biology, a wide range of genetic reagents, well-defined dietary requirements, and a relatively short life span, with a median of ~80 days and maximum ~100 days. Several phenotypes can be used to assess the aging process, but the simplest and most widely used metric is length of life. Here we describe a standard life span assay for Drosophila housed on a simple sugar/yeast diet.

%X Dietary restriction (DR) and mutations in nutrient signaling pathways can extend healthy life span in diverse organisms. Studying the interaction between these interventions should reveal mechanisms of aging, but has yielded some apparently contradictory results. A multidimensional representation of nutrition, called the geometric framework, can better describe the responses of life span and other traits, including metabolism, and can reconcile these apparent contradictions. We provide examples showing that it is more informative to analyze DR in terms of dietary balance and that dietary optimization for life span is critical for studies examining the biology of aging and other traits.

%X A critical requirement for research using model organisms is a well-defined and consistent diet. There is currently no complete chemically defined (holidic) diet available for Drosophila melanogaster. We describe a holidic medium that is equal in performance to an oligidic diet optimized for adult fecundity and lifespan. This holidic diet supports development over multiple generations but at a reduced rate. Over 7 years of experiments, the holidic diet yielded more consistent experimental outcomes than did oligidic food for egg laying by females. Nutrients and drugs were more available to flies in holidic medium and, similar to dietary restriction on oligidic food, amino acid dilution increased fly lifespan. We used this holidic medium to investigate amino acid-specific effects on food-choice behavior and report that folic acid from the microbiota is sufficient for Drosophila development.

%X Energy expenditure is a key variable in the study of ageing, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism that has been used to make step changes in our understanding of the ageing process. Standard methods for measurement of energy expenditure involve placing individuals in metabolic chambers where their oxygen consumption and CO2 production can be quantified. These measurements require separating individuals from any social context, and may only poorly reflect the environment in which the animals normally live. The doubly-labeled water (DLW) method is an isotope-based technique for measuring energy expenditure which overcomes these problems. However, technical challenges mean that the smallest animals this method has been previously applied to weighed 50–200 mg. We overcame these technical challenges to measure energy demands in Drosophila weighing 0.78 mg. Mass-specific energy expenditure varied between 43 and 65 mW·g−1. These estimates are considerably higher than estimates using indirect calorimetry of Drosophila in small metabolic chambers (around 18 mW·g−1). The methodology we have established extends downwards by three orders of magnitude the size of animals that can be measured using DLW. This approach may be of considerable value in future ageing research attempting to understand the genetic and genomic basis of ageing.

%X mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism. mTORC1 activity is regulated via integration of positive growth-promoting stimuli and negative stress stimuli. One stress cells confront in physiological and pathophysiological contexts is hyperosmotic stress. The mechanism by which hyperosmotic stress regulates mTORC1 activity is not well understood. We show here that mild hyperosmotic stress induces a rapid and reversible inactivation of mTORC1 via a mechanism involving multiple upstream signaling pathways. We find that hyperosmotic stress causes dynamic changes in TSC2 phosphorylation by upstream kinases, such as Akt, thereby recruiting TSC2 from the cytoplasm to lysosomes where it acts on Rheb, the direct activator of mTORC1. This work puts together a signaling pathway whereby hyperosmotic stress inactivates mTORC1.

%X Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) is one of the most powerful methods for studying global protein profiles. However, due to the multiple manual steps involved in gel based processing it is challenging to achieve the necessary overall reproducibility for a reliable comparative analysis, especially between different laboratories. To improve the 2-DE technique for quantitative analyses we have set up a robust 2-DE workflow, called 2D-ToGo, which utilizes latest innovations concerning instrumentation, consumables and protocols. Quantitative data analyses indicate the high reproducibility between replicate gels processed at a single site (intra-laboratory variation: CV 20%). The data-sets of the inter-laboratory comparison revealed similar results displaying a variation of CV 23%. The technical improvements given by our 2-DE workflow have a positive impact on process robustness and most importantly, reproducibility. Accordingly, many of the well-known challenges for resolving and quantitating up to thousands of different protein components in a given biological sample are minimized.

%X Mammalian mitochondrial transcription is executed by a single subunit mitochondrial RNA polymerase (Polrmt) and its two accessory factors, mitochondrial transcription factors A and B2 (Tfam and Tfb2m). Polrmt is structurally related to single-subunit phage RNA polymerases, but it also contains a unique N-terminal extension (NTE) of unknown function. We here demonstrate that the NTE functions together with Tfam to ensure promoter-specific transcription. When the NTE is deleted, Polrmt can initiate transcription in the absence of Tfam, both from promoters and non-specific DNA sequences. Additionally, when in presence of Tfam and a mitochondrial promoter, the NTE-deleted mutant has an even higher transcription activity than wild-type polymerase, indicating that the NTE functions as an inhibitory domain. Our studies lead to a model according to which Tfam specifically recruits wild-type Polrmt to promoter sequences, relieving the inhibitory effect of the NTE, as a first step in transcription initiation. In the second step, Tfb2m is recruited into the complex and transcription is initiated.

%X Cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondria-specific glycerophospholipid, is required for diverse mitochondrial processes and orchestrates the function of various death-inducing proteins during apoptosis. Here, we identify a complex of the p53-regulated protein TRIAP1 (p53CSV) and PRELI in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), which ensures the accumulation of CL in mitochondria. TRIAP1/PRELI complexes exert lipid transfer activity in vitro and supply phosphatidic acid (PA) for CL synthesis in the inner membrane. Loss of TRIAP1 or PRELI impairs the accumulation of CL, facilitates the release of cytochrome c, and renders cells vulnerable to apoptosis upon intrinsic and extrinsic stimulation. Survival of TRIAP1- and PRELI-deficient cells is conferred by an excess of exogenously provided phosphatidylglycerol. Our results reveal a p53-dependent cell-survival pathway and highlight the importance of the CL content of mitochondrial membranes in apoptosis.

%X The mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism critically depends on members of the conserved Ups1/PRELI-like protein family in the intermembrane space. Ups1 and Ups2 (also termed Gep1) were shown to regulate the accumulation of cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), respectively, in a lipid-specific but coordinated manner. It remained enigmatic, however, how the relative abundance of both phospholipids in mitochondrial membranes is adjusted on the molecular level. Here, we describe a novel regulatory circuit determining the accumulation of Ups1 and Ups2 in the intermembrane space. Ups1 and Ups2 are intrinsically unstable proteins, which are degraded by distinct mitochondrial peptidases. The turnover of Ups2 is mediated by the i-AAA protease Yme1, whereas Ups1 is degraded by both Yme1 and the metallopeptidase Atp23. We identified Mdm35, a member of the twin Cx(9)C protein family, as a novel interaction partner of Ups1 and Ups2. Binding to Mdm35 ensures import and protects both proteins against proteolysis. Homologues to all components of this pathway are present in higher eukaryotes, suggesting that the regulation of mitochondrial CL and PE levels is conserved in evolution.

%X Understanding molecular mechanisms of skin ageing is critical for developing effective anti-ageing strategies. Recently, it has been suggested that epigenetics maybe be involved in tissue ageing and age-related diseases; however, the evidence regarding skin ageing has been very limited. We ran a pilot study in mouse skin to test whether DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), DNA demethylases such as ten-eleven translocation enzymes (Tets) and DNA methylation of gene promoters change with age by quantitative RT-PCR and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-chip. We discovered that the expression of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and Tet2 declines significantly with skin ageing. The genome-wide DNA methylation analysis indicates that both hypermethylation and hypomethylation in promoters of genes are taken place. Functional category of those genes suggests that inhibition of cell proliferation and activation of immune response are important adaptations likely induced by skin ageing. These findings shed new light on epigenetic regulation of skin ageing.

%X Components or downstream targets of many signaling pathways such as Insulin/IGF-1 and TOR, as well as genes involved in cellular metabolism and bioenergetics can extend worm lifespan 20% or more. The C. elegans gene pch-2 and its homologs, including TRIP13 in humans, have been studied for their functions in cell mitosis and meiosis, but have never been implicated in lifespan regulation. Here we show that over-expression of TRIP13 in human fibroblasts confers resistance to environmental stressors such as UV radiation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, pch-2 overexpression in C. elegans extends worm lifespan, and enhances worm survival in response to various stressors. Conversely, reducing pch-2 expression with RNAi shortens worm lifespan. Additional genetic epistasis analysis indicates that the molecular mechanism of pch-2 in worm longevity is tied to functions of the sirtuin family, implying that pch-2 is another chromatin regulator for worm longevity. These findings suggest a novel function of the pch-2 gene involved in lifespan determination.

%X Recent advances in mitochondrial biology have revealed the high diversity and complexity of proteolytic enzymes that regulate mitochondrial function. We have classified mitochondrial proteases, or mitoproteases, on the basis of their function and location, and defined the human mitochondrial degradome as the complete set of mitoproteases that are encoded by the human genome. In addition to their nonspecific degradative functions, mitoproteases perform highly regulated proteolytic reactions that are important in mitochondrial function, integrity and homeostasis. These include protein synthesis, quality control, mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, mitophagy and apoptosis. Impaired or dysregulated function of mitoproteases is associated with ageing and with many pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes and cancer. A better understanding of the mitochondrial proteolytic landscape and its modulation may contribute to improving human lifespan and 'healthspan'.

%X Sirtuins are an ancient family of NAD(+)-dependent deacylases connected with the regulation of fundamental cellular processes including metabolic homeostasis and genome integrity. We show the existence of a hitherto unrecognized class of sirtuins, found predominantly in microbial pathogens. In contrast to earlier described classes, these sirtuins exhibit robust protein ADP-ribosylation activity. In our model organisms, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, the activity is dependent on prior lipoylation of the target protein and can be reversed by a sirtuin-associated macrodomain protein. Together, our data describe a sirtuin-dependent reversible protein ADP-ribosylation system and establish a crosstalk between lipoylation and mono-ADP-ribosylation. We propose that these posttranslational modifications modulate microbial virulence by regulating the response to host-derived reactive oxygen species.

%X Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an adaptor protein required to establish and maintain the connection between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. This linkage is essential for generating force between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cell during migration and matrix remodelling. The mechanisms by which ILK stability and turnover are regulated are unknown. Here we report that the E3 ligase CHIP-heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) axis regulates ILK turnover in fibroblasts. The chaperone Hsp90 stabilizes ILK and facilitates the interaction of ILK with alpha-parvin. When Hsp90 activity is blocked, ILK is ubiquitinated by CHIP and degraded by the proteasome, resulting in impaired fibroblast migration and a dramatic reduction in the fibrotic response to bleomycin in mice. Together, our results uncover how Hsp90 regulates ILK stability and identify a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate fibrotic diseases.

%X Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) invades its human host via the skin or mucosa. We aim to understand how HSV-1 overcomes the barrier function of the host epithelia, and for this reason, we established an ex vivo infection assay initially with murine skin samples. Here, we report how tissue has to be prepared to be susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Most efficient infection of the epidermis was achieved by removing the dermis. HSV-1 initially invaded the basal epidermal layer, and from there, spreading to the suprabasal layers was observed. Strikingly, in resting stage hair follicles, only the hair germ was infected, whereas the quiescent bulge stem cells (SCs) were resistant to infection. However, during the growth phase, infected cells were also detected in the activated bulge SCs. We demonstrated that cell proliferation was not a precondition for HSV-1 invasion, but SC activation was required as shown by infection of aberrantly activated bulge SCs in integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-deficient hair follicles. These results suggest that the status of the bulge SCs determines whether HSV-1 can reach its receptors, whereas the receptors on basal keratinocytes are accessible irrespective of their proliferation status.

%X An effective immune response requires B cells to produce several classes of antibodies through the process of class switch recombination (CSR). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase initiates CSR by deaminating deoxycytidines at switch regions within the Ig locus. This activity leads to double-stranded DNA break formation at the donor and recipient switch regions that are subsequently synapsed and ligated in a 53BP1-dependent process that remains poorly understood. The DNA damage response E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 were recently shown to facilitate recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage. Here we show that the ubiquitination pathway mediated by RNF8 and RNF168 plays an integral part in CSR. Using the CH12F3-2 mouse B cell line that undergoes CSR to IgA at high rates, we demonstrate that knockdown of RNF8, RNF168, and 53BP1 leads to a significant decrease in CSR. We also show that 53BP1-deficient CH12F3-2 cells are protected from apoptosis mediated by the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. In contrast, deficiency in either E3 ubiquitin ligase does not protect cells from Nutlin-3-mediated apoptosis, indicating that RNF8 and RNF168 do not regulate all functions of 53BP1.

%X Women live on average longer than men but have greater levels of late-life morbidity. We have uncovered a substantial sex difference in the pathology of the aging gut in Drosophila. The intestinal epithelium of the aging female undergoes major deterioration, driven by intestinal stem cell (ISC) division, while lower ISC activity in males associates with delay or absence of pathology, and better barrier function, even at old ages. Males succumb to intestinal challenges to which females are resistant, associated with fewer proliferating ISCs, suggesting a trade-off between highly active repair mechanisms and late-life pathology in females. Dietary restriction reduces gut pathology in aging females, and extends female lifespan more than male. By genetic sex reversal of a specific gut region, we induced female-like aging pathologies in males, associated with decreased lifespan, but also with a greater increase in longevity in response to dietary restriction.

%X Sex differences in lifespan exist world-wide, with women outliving men by more than a decade in some countries. The gender gap is not a uniquely human phenomenon; most sexually reproducing species examined show sex differences in patterns of ageing, yet a comprehensive explanation does not exist. Here, we discuss how ageing responds to natural selection on traits that arise as a consequence of sexuality. Sexual dimorphisms in vertebrates are mediated by sex-steroids, such as androgens and oestrogens, and we examine their regulation of biological processes that can affect ageing and lifespan. The sexes can respond differently to dietary restriction and altered activity of nutrient-sensing pathways, with females showing a greater plasticity for life extension. We suggest that the cross-regulation of steroid hormone and nutrient-sensing signalling pathways is a promising process for further study in understanding the biological basis for the gender gap.

%X Biphasic effects of cannabinoids have been shown in processes such as feeding behavior, motor activity, motivational processes and anxiety responses. Using two different tests for the characterization of anxiety-related behavior (elevated plus-maze and holeboard), we first identified in wild-type C57BL/6N mice, two doses of the synthetic CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist CP-55,940 with anxiolytic (1 mug/kg) and anxiogenic properties (50 mug/kg), respectively. To clarify the role of CB1 receptors in this biphasic effect, both doses were applied to two different conditional CB1 receptor knockout (KO) mouse lines, GABA-CB1-KO (CB1 receptor inactivation in forebrain GABAergic neurons) and Glu-CB1-KO (CB1 receptor inactivation in cortical glutamatergic neurons). We found that the anxiolytic-like effects of the low dose of cannabinoids are mediated via the CB1 receptor on cortical glutamatergic terminals, because this anxiolytic-like response was abrogated only in Glu-CB1-KO mice. On the contrary, the CB1 receptor on the GABAergic terminals is required to induce an anxiogenic-like effect under a high-dose treatment because of the fact that this effect was abolished specifically in GABA-CB1-KO mice. These experiments were carried out in both sexes, and no differences occurred with the doses tested in the mutant mice. Interestingly, the positive allosteric modulation of GABA(B) receptor with GS-39783 was found to largely abrogate the anxiogenic-like effect of the high dose of CP-55,940. Our results shed new light in further understanding the biphasic effects of cannabinoids at the molecular level and, importantly, pave the way for the development of novel anxiolytic cannabinoid drugs, which may have favorable effect profiles targeting the CB1 receptor on glutamatergic terminals.

%X The recognition and translation of mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs are poorly understood. To gain further insights into these processes in vivo, we characterized mice with a missense mutation that causes loss of the translational activator of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (TACO1). We report that TACO1 is not required for embryonic survival, although the mutant mice have substantially reduced COXI protein, causing an isolated complex IV deficiency. We show that TACO1 specifically binds the mt-Co1 mRNA and is required for translation of COXI through its association with the mitochondrial ribosome. We determined the atomic structure of TACO1, revealing three domains in the shape of a hook with a tunnel between domains 1 and 3. Mutations in the positively charged domain 1 reduce RNA binding by TACO1. The Taco1 mutant mice develop a late-onset visual impairment, motor dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy and thus provide a useful model for future treatment trials for mitochondrial disease.

%X Prohibitins form large protein and lipid scaffolds in the inner membrane of mitochondria that are required for mitochondrial morphogenesis, neuronal survival, and normal lifespan. Here, we have defined the interactome of PHB2 in mitochondria and identified DNAJC19, mutated in dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia, as binding partner of PHB complexes. We observed impaired cell growth, defective cristae morphogenesis, and similar transcriptional responses in the absence of either DNAJC19 or PHB2. The loss of PHB/DNAJC19 complexes affects cardiolipin acylation and leads to the accumulation of cardiolipin species with altered acyl chains. Similar defects occur in cells lacking the transacylase tafazzin, which is mutated in Barth syndrome. Our experiments suggest that PHB/DNAJC19 membrane domains regulate cardiolipin remodeling by tafazzin and explain similar clinical symptoms in two inherited cardiomyopathies by an impaired cardiolipin metabolism in mitochondrial membranes.

%X <p>Age is the major risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), for reasons that are not clear. The association could indicate that the duration or degree of exposure to toxic proteins is important for pathology, or that age itself increases susceptibility to protein toxicity. Using an inducible <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of AD, we investigated these possibilities by varying the expression of an Aβ42 transgene in neurons at different adult ages and measuring the effects on Aβ42 levels and associated pathological phenotypes. Acute induction of Arctic Aβ42 in young adult flies resulted in rapid expression and clearance of mRNA and soluble Arctic Aβ42 protein, but in irreversible expression of insoluble Arctic Aβ42 peptide. Arctic Aβ42 peptide levels accumulated with longer durations of induction, and this led to a dose-dependent reduction in negative geotaxis and lifespan. For a standardised level of mRNA expression, older flies had higher levels of Arctic Aβ42 peptide and associated toxicity, and this correlated with an age-dependent reduction in proteasome activity. Equalising Aβ42 protein at different ages shortened lifespan in correlation with the duration of exposure to the peptide, suggesting that Aβ42 expression accumulates damage over time. However, the relative reduction in lifespan compared to controls was greater in flies first exposed to the peptide at older ages, suggesting that ageing itself also increases susceptibility to Aβ42 toxicity. Indeed older flies were more vulnerable to chronic Aβ42 toxicity even with a much lower lifetime exposure to the peptide. Finally, the persistence of insoluble Aβ42 in both young and old induced flies suggests that aggregated forms of the peptide cause toxicity in later life. Our results suggest that reduced protein turnover, increased duration of exposure and increased vulnerability to protein toxicity at later ages in combination could explain the late age-of-onset of neurodegenerative phenotypes.</p>

%X At present, there are few means to track symptomatic stages of CNS aging. Thus, although metabolic changes are implicated in mtDNA mutation-driven aging, the manifestations remain unclear. Here, we used normally aging and prematurely aging mtDNA mutator mice to establish a molecular link between mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal metabolism in the aging process. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC, we found that brain lactate levels were increased twofold in both normally and prematurely aging mice during aging. To correlate the striking increase in lactate with tissue pathology, we investigated the respiratory chain enzymes and detected mitochondrial failure in key brain areas from both normally and prematurely aging mice. We used in situ hybridization to show that increased brain lactate levels were caused by a shift in transcriptional activities of the lactate dehydrogenases to promote pyruvate to lactate conversion. Separation of the five tetrameric lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes revealed an increase of those dominated by the Ldh-A product and a decrease of those rich in the Ldh-B product, which, in turn, increases pyruvate to lactate conversion. Spectrophotometric assays measuring LDH activity from the pyruvate and lactate sides of the reaction showed a higher pyruvate --> lactate activity in the brain. We argue for the use of lactate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a noninvasive strategy for monitoring this hallmark of the aging process. The mtDNA mutator mouse allows us to conclude that the increased LDH-A/LDH-B ratio causes high brain lactate levels, which, in turn, are predictive of aging phenotypes.

%X Ageing is due to an accumulation of various types of damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction has long been considered to be important in this process. There is substantial sequence variation in mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and the high mutation rate is counteracted by different mechanisms that decrease maternal transmission of mutated mtDNA. Despite these protective mechanisms, it is becoming increasingly clear that low-level mtDNA heteroplasmy is quite common and often inherited in humans. We designed a series of mouse mutants to investigate the extent to which inherited mtDNA mutations can contribute to ageing. Here we report that maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations can induce mild ageing phenotypes in mice with a wild-type nuclear genome. Furthermore, maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations lead to anticipation of reduced fertility in mice that are heterozygous for the mtDNA mutator allele (PolgA(wt/mut)) and aggravate premature ageing phenotypes in mtDNA mutator mice (PolgA(mut/mut)). Unexpectedly, a combination of maternally transmitted and somatic mtDNA mutations also leads to stochastic brain malformations. Our findings show that a pre-existing mutation load will not only allow somatic mutagenesis to create a critically high total mtDNA mutation load sooner but will also increase clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations to enhance the normally occurring mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in ageing tissues. Our findings suggest that maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations may have a similar role in aggravating aspects of normal human ageing.

%X F-box proteins and DCAF proteins are the substrate binding subunits of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) and Cul4-RING protein ligase (CRL4) ubiquitin ligase complexes, respectively. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we determined that the F-box protein FBXO11 interacts with CDT2, a DCAF protein that controls cell-cycle progression, and recruits CDT2 to the SCF(FBXO11)complex to promote its proteasomal degradation. In contrast to most SCF substrates, which exhibit phosphodegron-dependent binding to F-box proteins, CDK-mediated phosphorylation of Thr464 present in the CDT2 degron inhibits recognition by FBXO11. Finally, our results show that the functional interaction between FBXO11 and CDT2 is evolutionary conserved from worms to humans and plays an important role in regulating the timing of cell-cycle exit.

%X NKG2D, an activating receptor expressed on NK cells and T cells, is critically involved in tumor immunosurveillance. In this study, we explored the potential therapeutic utility of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 for the treatment of colon carcinoma. To this end we designed a fusion protein consisting of human ULBP2 and an antibody-derived single chain targeting the tumor carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The bispecific recombinant fusion protein re-directed NK cells towards malignant cells by binding to both, tumor cells and NK cells, and triggered NK cell-mediated target cell killing in vitro. Moreover, tumor growth was significantly delayed in a syngeneic colon carcinoma mouse model in response to immunoligand treatment. The anti-tumor activity could be attributed to the stimulation of immune cells with an elevated expression of the activation marker CD69 on NK, T and NKT cells and the infiltration of CD45+ immune cells into the solid tumor. In summary, it was demonstrated that immunoligands provide specific tumor targeting by NK cells and exert anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. This technology represents a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for solid tumors with the potential to be further developed for clinical applications.

%X C. elegans diapause, gonadal outgrowth, and life span are regulated by a lipophilic hormone, which serves as a ligand to the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12. A key step in hormone production is catalyzed by the CYP450 DAF-9, but the extent of the biosynthetic pathway is unknown. Here, we identify a conserved Rieske-like oxygenase, DAF-36, as a component in hormone metabolism. Mutants display larval developmental and adult aging phenotypes, as well as patterns of epistasis similar to that of daf-9. Larval phenotypes are potently reversed by crude lipid extracts, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and a recently identified DAF-12 sterol ligand, suggesting that DAF-36 works early in the hormone biosynthetic pathway. DAF-36 is expressed primarily within the intestine, a major organ of metabolic and endocrine control, distinct from DAF-9. These results imply that C. elegans hormone production has multiple steps and is distributed, and that it may provide one way that tissues register their current physiological state during organismal commitments.

%X Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive and cell-specific axonal degeneration. An autosomal recessive form of the disease is caused by mutations in paraplegin, which is a conserved subunit of the ubiquitous and ATP-dependent m-AAA protease in mitochondria. The m-AAA protease carries out protein quality control in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, suggesting a pathogenic role of misfolded proteins in HSP. A recent study demonstrates that the m-AAA protease regulates ribosome assembly and translation within mitochondria by controlling proteolytic maturation of a ribosomal subunit. Here, we will discuss implications of the dual role of the m-AAA protease in protein activation and degradation for mitochondrial dysfunction and axonal degeneration.

%X Neuronal survival critically depends on the integrity and functionality of mitochondria. A hierarchical system of cellular surveillance mechanisms protects mitochondria against stress, monitors mitochondrial damage and ensures the selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondrial proteins or organelles. Mitochondrial proteases emerge as central regulators that coordinate different quality control (QC) pathways within an interconnected network of mechanisms. A failure of this system causes neuronal loss in a steadily increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders, which include Parkinson's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, spastic paraplegia and peripheral neuropathies. Here, we will discuss the role of the mitochondrial QC network for neuronal survival and neurodegeneration.

%X Regulation of mtDNA expression is critical for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and may, in principle, occur at many different levels. The leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC) protein regulates mitochondrial mRNA stability and an amino-acid substitution of this protein causes the French-Canadian type of Leigh syndrome (LSFC), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex IV deficiency. We have generated conditional Lrpprc knockout mice and show here that the gene is essential for embryonic development. Tissue-specific disruption of Lrpprc in heart causes mitochondrial cardiomyopathy with drastic reduction in steady-state levels of most mitochondrial mRNAs. LRPPRC forms an RNA-dependent protein complex that is necessary for maintaining a pool of non-translated mRNAs in mammalian mitochondria. Loss of LRPPRC does not only decrease mRNA stability, but also leads to loss of mRNA polyadenylation and the appearance of aberrant mitochondrial translation. The translation pattern without the presence of LRPPRC is misregulated with excessive translation of some transcripts and no translation of others. Our findings point to the existence of an elaborate machinery that regulates mammalian mtDNA expression at the post-transcriptional level.

%X The helicase RTEL1 promotes t-loop unwinding and suppresses telomere fragility to maintain the integrity of vertebrate telomeres. An interaction between RTEL1 and PCNA is important to prevent telomere fragility, but how RTEL1 engages with the telomere to promote t-loop unwinding is unclear. Here, we establish that the shelterin protein TRF2 recruits RTEL1 to telomeres in S phase, which is required to prevent catastrophic t-loop processing by structure-specific nucleases. We show that the TRF2-RTEL1 interaction is mediated by a metal-coordinating C4C4 motif in RTEL1, which is compromised by the Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS) mutation, RTEL1(R1264H). Conversely, we define a TRF2(I124D) substitution mutation within the TRFH domain of TRF2, which eliminates RTEL1 binding and phenocopies the RTEL1(R1264H) mutation, giving rise to aberrant t-loop excision, telomere length heterogeneity, and loss of the telomere as a circle. These results implicate TRF2 in the recruitment of RTEL1 to facilitate t-loop disassembly at telomeres in S phase.

%X Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has become one of the best curable cancers. However, better biomarkers are needed for outcome prediction that would allow protecting patients from over- or under-dosing of treatment. Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/CCL17 (TARC) is highly and specifically elevated in this disease and has been proposed as possible biomarker in HL patients. In this study, we show that pretreatment TARC levels were associated with established clinical risk factors and predictive for response to treatment in a large cohort of HL patients treated in clinical trials by the German Hodgkin Study Group. Moreover, TARC levels also significantly contributed to a novel multivariate model predicting treatment response. These data clearly suggest an important role for this chemokine as biomarker in HL.

%X Many animals can choose between different developmental fates to maximize fitness. Despite the complexity of environmental cues and life history, different developmental fates are executed in a robust fashion. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans serves as a powerful model to examine this phenomenon because it can adopt one of two developmental fates (adulthood or diapause) depending on environmental conditions. The steroid hormone dafachronic acid (DA) directs development to adulthood by regulating the transcriptional activity of the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12. The known role of DA suggests that it may be the molecular mediator of environmental condition effects on the developmental fate decision, although the mechanism is yet unknown. We used a combination of physiological and molecular biology techniques to demonstrate that commitment to reproductive adult development occurs when DA levels, produced in the neuroendocrine XXX cells, exceed a threshold. Furthermore, imaging and cell ablation experiments demonstrate that the XXX cells act as a source of DA, which, upon commitment to adult development, is amplified and propagated in the epidermis in a DAF-12 dependent manner. This positive feedback loop increases DA levels and drives adult programs in the gonad and epidermis, thus conferring the irreversibility of the decision. We show that the positive feedback loop canalizes development by ensuring that sufficient amounts of DA are dispersed throughout the body and serves as a robust fate-locking mechanism to enforce an organism-wide binary decision, despite noisy and complex environmental cues. These mechanisms are not only relevant to C. elegans but may be extended to other hormonal-based decision-making mechanisms in insects and mammals.

%X Lipids are the building blocks of cellular membranes and are synthesized at distinct parts of the cell. A precise control of lipid synthesis and distribution is crucial for cell function and survival. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major lipid-synthesizing organelle. However, a subset of lipids is synthesized within mitochondria, and this aspect has become a focus of recent lipid research. Mitochondria form a dynamic membrane network that is reshaped by fusion and fission events. Their functionality therefore depends on a continuous lipid supply from the ER and the distribution of lipids between both mitochondrial membranes. The mechanisms of mitochondrial lipid trafficking are only now emerging and appear to involve membrane contact sites and lipid transfer proteins. In this Cell Science at a Glance article, we will discuss recent discoveries in the field of mitochondrial lipid trafficking that build on long-standing observations and shed new light on the shuttling of membrane lipids between mitochondria and other organelles.

%X Cell migration is mediated by the dynamic remodeling of focal adhesions (FAs). Recently, an important role of endosomal signaling in regulation of cell migration was recognized. Here, we show an essential function for late endosomes carrying the p14-MP1 (LAMTOR2/3) complex in FA dynamics. p14-MP1-positive endosomes move to the cell periphery along microtubules (MTs) in a kinesin1- and Arl8b-dependent manner. There they specifically target FAs to regulate FA turnover, which is required for cell migration. Using genetically modified fibroblasts from p14-deficient mice and Arl8b-depleted cells, we demonstrate that MT plus end-directed traffic of p14-MP1-positive endosomes triggered IQGAP1 disassociation from FAs. The release of IQGAP was required for FA dynamics. Taken together, our results suggest that late endosomes contribute to the regulation of cell migration by transporting the p14-MP1 scaffold complex to the vicinity of FAs.

%X Many proteins are regulated by a variety of post-translational modifications, and orchestration of these modifications is frequently required for full control of activity. Currently little is known about the combinatorial activity of different post-translational modifications. Here we show that extensive cross-talk exists between sumoylation and ubiquitination. We found that a subset of SUMO-2-conjugated proteins is subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. In a screen for preferential SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 target proteins, we found that ubiquitin accumulated in purified SUMO-2 conjugates but not in SUMO-1 conjugates. Upon inhibition of the proteasome, the amount of ubiquitin in purified SUMO-2 conjugates increased. In addition, we found that endogenous SUMO-2/3 conjugates, but not endogenous SUMO-1 conjugates, accumulated in response to proteasome inhibitors. Quantitative proteomics experiments enabled the identification of 73 SUMO-2-conjugated proteins that accumulated in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. Cross-talk between SUMO-2/3 and the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls many target proteins that regulate all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. Surprisingly the relative abundance of 40 SUMO-2-conjugated proteins was reduced by proteasome inhibitors possibly because of a lack of recycled SUMO-2. We conclude that SUMO-2/3 conjugation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are tightly integrated and act in a cooperative manner.

%X Treatment with EGFR kinase inhibitors improves progression-free survival of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. However, all patients with initial response will eventually acquire resistance and die from tumor recurrence. We found that intermittent high-dose treatment with erlotinib induced apoptosis more potently and improved tumor shrinkage significantly than the established low doses. In mice carrying EGFR-mutant xenografts intermittent high-dose treatment (200 mg/kg every other day) was tolerable and prolonged progression-free survival and reduced the frequency of acquired resistance. Intermittent EGFR-targeted high-dose schedules induce more profound as well as sustained target inhibition and may afford enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

%X BACKGROUND: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) mediate mRNA biogenesis, translation and decay. We recently developed an approach to profile transcriptome-wide RBP contacts on polyadenylated transcripts by next-generation sequencing. A comparison of such profiles from different biological conditions has the power to unravel dynamic changes in protein-contacted cis-regulatory mRNA regions without a priori knowledge of the regulatory protein component. RESULTS: We compared protein occupancy profiles of polyadenylated transcripts in MCF7 and HEK293 cells. Briefly, we developed a bioinformatics workflow to identify differential crosslinking sites in cDNA reads of 4-thiouridine crosslinked polyadenylated RNA samples. We identified 30,000 differential crosslinking sites between MCF7 and HEK293 cells at an estimated false discovery rate of 10%. 73% of all reported differential protein-RNA contact sites cannot be explained by local changes in exon usage as indicated by complementary RNA-seq data. The majority of differentially crosslinked positions are located in 3' UTRs, show distinct secondary-structure characteristics and overlap with binding sites of known RBPs, such as ELAVL1. Importantly, mRNA transcripts with the most significant occupancy changes show elongated mRNA half-lives in MCF7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: We present a global comparison of protein occupancy profiles from different cell types, and provide evidence for altered mRNA metabolism as a result of differential protein-RNA contacts. Additionally, we introduce POPPI, a bioinformatics workflow for the analysis of protein occupancy profiling experiments. Our work demonstrates the value of protein occupancy profiling for assessing cis-regulatory RNA sequence space and its dynamics in growth, development and disease.

%X Ever increasing evidence has been provided on the accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) during the aging process. However, the lack of direct functional consequences of the mutant mtDNA load on the mitochondria-dependent cell metabolism has raised many questions on the physiological importance of the age-related mtDNA variations. In the present work, we have analyzed the bioenergetic properties associated with the age-related T414G mutation of the mtDNA control region in transmitochondrial cybrids. The results show that the T414G mutation does not cause per se any detectable bioenergetic change. Moreover, three mtDNA mutations clustered in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene cosegregated together with the T414G in the same cybrid cell line. Two of them, namely T1843C and A1940G, are novel and associate with a negative bioenergetic phenotype. The results are discussed in the more general context of the complex heterogeneity and the dramatic instability of the mitochondrial genome during cell culture of transmitochondrial cybrids.

%X We previously reported that global deletion of insulin receptor substrate protein 1 (Irs1) extends lifespan and increases resistance to several age-related pathologies in female mice. However, no effect on lifespan was observed in male Irs1 null mice. We suggested at the time that the lack of any effect in males might have been due to a sample size issue. While such lifespan studies are essential to our understanding of the aging process, they are generally based on survival curves derived from single experiments, primarily due to time and economic constraints. Consequently, the robustness of such findings as a basis for further investigation has been questioned. We have therefore measured lifespan in a second, separate cohort of Irs1 null female mice, and show that, consistent with our previous finding, global deletion of Irs1 significantly extends lifespan in female mice. In addition, an augmented and completed study demonstrates lifespan extension in male Irs1 null mice. Therefore, we show that reduced IRS1-dependent signalling is a robust mechanism through which mammalian lifespan can be modulated.

%X Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is characterized by autosomal dominant heritability and early disease onset. Mutations in the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1) are found in approximately 80% of cases of FAD, with some of these patients presenting cerebellar damage with amyloid plaques and ataxia with unclear pathophysiology. A Colombian kindred carrying the PS1-E280A mutation is the largest known cohort of PS1-FAD patients. Here, we investigated PS1-E280A-associated cerebellar dysfunction and found that it occurs early in PS1-E208A carriers, while cerebellar signs are highly prevalent in patients with dementia. Postmortem analysis of cerebella of PS1-E280A carrier revealed greater Purkinje cell (PC) loss and more abnormal mitochondria compared with controls. In PS1-E280A tissue, ER/mitochondria tethering was impaired, Ca2+ channels IP3Rs and CACNA1A were downregulated, and Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial transport proteins MIRO1 and KIF5C were reduced. Accordingly, expression of PS1-E280A in a neuronal cell line altered ER/mitochondria tethering and transport compared with that in cells expressing wild-type PS1. In a murine model of PS1-FAD, animals exhibited mild ataxia and reduced PC simple spike activity prior to cerebellar beta-amyloid deposition. Our data suggest that impaired calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction in PS1-FAD PCs reduces their activity and contributes to motor coordination deficits prior to Abeta aggregation and dementia. We propose that PS1-E280A affects both Ca2+ homeostasis and Abeta precursor processing, leading to FAD and neurodegeneration.

%X Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation is a post-translational protein modification implicated in the regulation of a range of cellular processes. A family of proteins that catalyse ADP-ribosylation reactions are the poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerases (PARPs). PARPs covalently attach an ADP-ribose nucleotide to target proteins and some PARP family members can subsequently add additional ADP-ribose units to generate a PAR chain. The hydrolysis of PAR chains is catalysed by PAR glycohydrolase (PARG). PARG is unable to cleave the mono(ADP-ribose) unit directly linked to the protein and although the enzymatic activity that catalyses this reaction has been detected in mammalian cell extracts, the protein(s) responsible remain unknown. Here, we report the homozygous mutation of the c6orf130 gene in patients with severe neurodegeneration, and identify C6orf130 as a PARP-interacting protein that removes mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation on glutamate amino acid residues in PARP-modified proteins. X-ray structures and biochemical analysis of C6orf130 suggest a mechanism of catalytic reversal involving a transient C6orf130 lysyl-(ADP-ribose) intermediate. Furthermore, depletion of C6orf130 protein in cells leads to proliferation and DNA repair defects. Collectively, our data suggest that C6orf130 enzymatic activity has a role in the turnover and recycling of protein ADP-ribosylation, and we have implicated the importance of this protein in supporting normal cellular function in humans.

%D 2014
%X We have previously identified transcription factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) as a type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk gene, using human and mouse genetics. To further understand the function of TFB1M and how it is associated with T2D, we created a β-cell-specific knockout of Tfb1m, which gradually developed diabetes. Prior to the onset of diabetes, β-Tfb1m(-/-) mice exhibited retarded glucose clearance owing to impaired insulin secretion. β-Tfb1m(-/-) islets released less insulin in response to fuels, contained less insulin and secretory granules and displayed reduced β-cell mass. Moreover, mitochondria in Tfb1m-deficient β-cells were more abundant with disrupted architecture. TFB1M is known to control mitochondrial protein translation by adenine dimethylation of 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Here, we found that the levels of TFB1M and mitochondrial-encoded proteins, mitochondrial 12S rRNA methylation, ATP production and oxygen consumption were reduced in β-Tfb1m(-/-) islets. Furthermore, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to cellular stress were increased whereas induction of defense mechanisms was attenuated. We also show increased apoptosis and necrosis as well as infiltration of macrophages and CD4(+) cells in the islets. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Tfb1m-deficiency in β-cells caused mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequently diabetes owing to combined loss of β-cell function and mass. These observations reflect pathogenetic processes in human islets: using RNA sequencing, we found that the TFB1M risk variant exhibited a negative gene-dosage effect on islet TFB1M mRNA levels, as well as insulin secretion. Our findings highlight the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in impairments of β-cell function and mass, the hallmarks of T2D.

%X AAA proteases are membrane-bound ATP-dependent proteases that are present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts and that can degrade membrane proteins. Recent evidence suggests dislocation of membrane-embedded substrates for proteolysis to occur in a hydrophilic environment; however, next to nothing is known about the mechanism of this process. Here, we have analysed the role of the membrane-spanning domains of Yta10 and Yta12, which are conserved subunits of the hetero-oligomeric m-AAA protease in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the m-AAA protease retains proteolytic activity after deletion of the transmembrane segments of either Yta10 or Yta12. Although the mutant m-AAA protease is still capable of processing cytochrome c peroxidase and degrading a peripheral membrane protein, proteolysis of integral membrane proteins is impaired. We therefore propose that transmembrane segments of m-AAA protease subunits have a direct role in the dislocation of membrane-embedded substrates.

%X In a recent Nature paper, Tatar and colleagues show that inhibition of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling specifically in the adipose tissue of Drosophila melanogaster retards organismal aging, increases resistance to oxidative stress, augments lipid deposition, and restricts insulin signaling in peripheral tissues by a cell-non-autonomous mechanism. Consistent with recent work in the worm, these results suggest that insulin/IGF signaling itself may mediate communication among various tissues to influence organismal longevity.

%X In response to the environment, the nematode C. elegans must choose between arrest at a long-lived alternate third larval stage, the dauer diapause, or reproductive development. This decision may ultimately be mediated by daf-9, a cytochrome P450 related to steroidogenic hydroxylases and its cognate nuclear receptor daf-12, implying organism-wide coordination by lipophilic hormones. Accordingly, here we show that daf-9(+) works cell non-autonomously to bypass diapause, and promote gonadal outgrowth. Among daf-9-expressing cells, the hypodermis is most visibly regulated by environmental inputs, including dietary cholesterol. On in reproductive growth, off in dauer, hypodermal daf-9 expression is strictly daf-12 dependent, suggesting feedback regulation. Expressing daf-9 constitutively in hypodermis rescues dauer phenotypes of daf-9, as well as insulin/IGF receptor and TGFbeta mutants, revealing that daf-9 is an important downstream point of control within the dauer circuits. This study illuminates how endocrine networks integrate environmental cues and transduce them into adaptive life history choices.

%X Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number regulation is altered in several human mtDNA-mutation diseases and it is also important in a variety of normal physiological processes. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is essential for human mtDNA transcription and we demonstrate here that it is also a key regulator of mtDNA copy number. We initially performed in vitro transcription studies and determined that the human TFAM protein is a poor activator of mouse mtDNA transcription, despite its high capacity for unspecific DNA binding. Next, we generated P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing human TFAM. The introduced human TFAM gene was regulated in a similar fashion as the endogenous mouse Tfam gene and expression of the human TFAM protein in the mouse did not result in down-regulation of the endogenous expression. The PAC-TFAM mice thus had a net overexpression of TFAM protein and this resulted in a general increase of mtDNA copy number. We used a combination of mice with TFAM overexpression and TFAM knockout and demonstrated that mtDNA copy number is directly proportional to the total TFAM protein levels also in mouse embryos. Interestingly, the expression of human TFAM in the mouse results in up-regulation of mtDNA copy number without increasing respiratory chain capacity or mitochondrial mass. It is thus possible to experimentally dissociate mtDNA copy number regulation from mtDNA expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in mammals in vivo. In conclusion, our results provide genetic evidence for a novel role for TFAM in direct regulation of mtDNA copy number in mammals.

%X Impaired proteolysis and protein folding leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates has been implicated in a series of neurodegenerative disorders. Research in this field has emphasised the important role of protein quality control systems consisting of molecular chaperones, proteases and ancillary factors in disease mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction has recently been linked to neurodegeneration by the identification of disease-causing mutations in components of the highly conserved and ubiquitous organellar quality control system. These include a membrane-bound ATP-dependent AAA protease as well as the mitochondrial chaperonin Hsp60. A functional impairment of either component causes axonal degeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This review summarises our current knowledge on mitochondrial protein quality control and its implications for the pathogenesis of HSP.

%X Mmutations in paraplegin, a putative mitochondrial metallopeptidase of the AAA family, cause an autosomal recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Here, we analyze the function of paraplegin at the cellular level and characterize the phenotypic defects of HSP patients' cells lacking this protein. We demonstrate that paraplegin coassembles with a homologous protein, AFG3L2, in the mitochondrial inner membrane. These two proteins form a high molecular mass complex, which we show to be aberrant in HSP fibroblasts. The loss of this complex causes a reduced complex I activity in mitochondria and an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress, which can both be rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type paraplegin. Furthermore, complementation studies in yeast demonstrate functional conservation of the human paraplegin-AFG3L2 complex with the yeast m-AAA protease and assign proteolytic activity to this structure. These results shed new light on the molecular pathogenesis of HSP and functionally link AFG3L2 to this neurodegenerative disease.

%X The integrity of the inner membrane of mitochondria is maintained by a membrane-embedded quality control system that ensures the removal of misfolded membrane proteins. Two ATP-dependent AAA proteases with catalytic sites at opposite membrane surfaces are key components of this proteolytic system. Here we describe the identification of a novel conserved metallopeptidase that exerts activities overlapping with the m-AAA protease and was therefore termed Oma1. Both peptidases are integral parts of the inner membrane and mediate the proteolytic breakdown of a misfolded derivative of the polytopic inner membrane protein Oxa1. The m-AAA protease cleaves off the matrix-exposed C-terminal domain of Oxa1 and processively degrades its transmembrane domain. In the absence of the m-AAA protease, proteolysis of Oxa1 is mediated in an ATP-independent manner by Oma1 and a yet unknown peptidase resulting in the accumulation of N- and C-terminal proteolytic fragments. Oma1 exposes its proteolytic center to the matrix side; however, mapping of Oma1 cleavage sites reveals clipping of Oxa1 in loop regions at both membrane surfaces. These results identify Oma1 as a novel component of the quality control system in the inner membrane of mitochondria. Proteins homologous to Oma1 are present in higher eukaryotic cells, eubacteria and archaebacteria, suggesting that Oma1 is the founding member of a conserved family of membrane-embedded metallopeptidases.

%X We have recently fully reconstituted the basal human mitochondrial transcription machinery in a pure in vitro system. Surprisingly, we found two different transcription factors (TFB1M and TFB2M) that each interact with mitochondrial RNA polymerase in human mitochondria, whereas there is only one such factor in budding yeast mitochondria. This unexpected finding raised important questions concerning the regulation of mitochondrial transcription in mammals in general and in other metazoans. We have now further analyzed putative homologs to TFB1M and TFB2M in different species. We mapped the mouse homologs, Tfb1m and Tfb2m, by linkage analysis to mouse Chr 17 and Chr 1, respectively. These regions display conserved linkage synteny with human Chr 6 and Chr 1, where TFB1M and TFB2M map. The intron-exon arrangements of Tfb1m and TFB1M and of Tfb2m and TFB2M were identical, and the promoter regions had similar predicted recognition elements for transcriptional factors NRF2 and Sp1. Northern blot analyses showed that Tfb1m and Tfb2m were ubiquitously expressed and had expression patterns that were very similar to the previously reported expression patterns for TFB1M and TFB2M. These findings show that Tfb1m and Tfb2m indeed are orthologs to TFB1M and TFB2M. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that most metazoans have two TFBM genes, since putative homologs to both TFB1M and TFB2M were found in D. melanogaster. Our data thus suggest that a duplication event of the TFBM gene in early metazoan evolution has permitted a more flexible regulation of mtDNA transcription, possibly in response to the complex physiological demands of multicellular organisms.

%X The glycine-alanine (GA) repeat of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 inhibits in cis ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in mammalian cells through a yet unknown mechanism. In the present study we demonstrate that the GA repeat targets an evolutionarily conserved step in proteolysis since it can prevent the degradation of proteasomal substrates in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Insertion of yeast codon-optimised recombinant GA (rGA) repeats of different length in green fluorescent protein reporters harbouring N-end rule or ubiquitin fusion degradation signals resulted in efficient stabilisation of these substrates. Protection was also achieved in rpn10delta yeast suggesting that this polyubiquitin binding protein is not required for the rGA effect. The conserved effect of the GA repeat in yeast opens the possibility for the use of genetic screens to unravel its mode of action.

%X Mitochondrial disorders are caused by deficient respiratory chain function, resulting in a complex series of pathophysiological events. Genetic counselling is complicated because the respiratory chain subunits are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA genes. Only a minority of the nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function have been identified, and even fewer are associated with human mitochondrial disease. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA are particularly challenging because of the complexities of mitochondrial genetics: the mitochondrial DNA is strictly maternally inherited; there are 10(3)-10(4) copies of mitochondrial DNA in somatic cells; affected individuals often have a mixture of normal and mutated mitochondrial DNA (mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy), the level of mutated mitochondrial DNA (the mitochondrial DNA mutation load) may vary widely between different maternally related individuals, between tissues and with time; a particular minimal threshold of mutated mitochondrial DNA is required to impair respiratory chain function; and there is not always a good correlation between mutant load and phenotype.

%X The inner membrane of mitochondria is one of the protein's richest cellular membranes. The biogenesis of the respiratory chain and ATP-synthase complexes present in this membrane is an intricate process requiring the coordinated function of various membrane-bound proteins including protein translocases and assembly factors. It is therefore not surprising that a distinct quality control system is present in this membrane that selectively removes nonassembled polypeptides and prevents their possibly deleterious accumulation in the membrane. The key components of this system are two AAA proteases, membrane-embedded ATP-dependent proteolytic complexes, which expose their catalytic sites at opposite membrane surfaces. Other components include the prohibitin complex with apparently chaperone-like properties and a regulatory function during proteolysis and a recently identified ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that exports peptides derived from the degradation of membrane proteins from the matrix to the intermembrane space. All of these components are highly conserved during evolution and appear to be ubiquitously present in mitochondria of eukaryotic cells, indicating important cellular functions. This review will summarize our current understanding of this proteolytic system and, in particular, focus on the mechanisms guiding the degradation of membrane proteins by AAA proteases.

%X Characterization of the basic transcription machinery of mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is of fundamental biological interest and may also lead to therapeutic interventions for human diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we report that mitochondrial transcription factors B1 (TFB1M) and B2 (TFB2M) are necessary for basal transcription of mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Human TFB1M and TFB2M are expressed ubiquitously and can each support promoter-specific mtDNA transcription in a pure recombinant in vitro system containing mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and mitochondrial transcription factor A. Both TFB1M and TFB2M interact directly with POLRMT, but TFB2M is at least one order of magnitude more active in promoting transcription than TFB1M. Both factors are highly homologous to bacterial rRNA dimethyltransferases, which suggests that an RNA-modifying enzyme has been recruited during evolution to function as a mitochondrial transcription factor. The presence of two proteins that interact with mammalian POLRMT may allow flexible regulation of mtDNA gene expression in response to the complex physiological demands of mammalian metabolism.

%X During C. elegans development, animals must choose between reproductive growth or dauer diapause in response to sensory cues. Insulin/IGF-I and TGF-beta signaling converge on the orphan nuclear receptor daf-12 to mediate this choice. Here we show that daf-9 acts downstream of these inputs but upstream of daf-12. daf-9 and daf-12 mutants have similar larval defects and modulate insulin/IGF-I and gonadal signals that regulate adult life span. daf-9 encodes a cytochrome P450 related to vertebrate steroidogenic hydroxylases, suggesting that it could metabolize a DAF-12 ligand. Sterols may be the daf-9 substrate and daf-12 ligand because cholesterol deprivation phenocopies mutant defects. Sensory neurons, hypodermis, and somatic gonadal cells expressing daf-9 identify potential endocrine tissues. Evidently, lipophilic hormones influence nematode metabolism, diapause, and life span.

%X Elucidation of the pathogenesis in respiratory chain diseases is of great importance for developing specific treatments. The limitations inherent to the use of patient material make studies of human tissues often difficult and the mouse has therefore emerged as a suitable model organism for studies of respiratory chain diseases. In this review, we present an overview of the field and discuss in depth a few examples of animal models reproducing pathology of human disease with primary and secondary respiratory chain involvement.

%X Mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) is required for mtDNA maintenance, and mitochondrial Tfam protein levels directly affect mtDNA copy number. Previous studies have shown significant reduction of Tfam protein levels in mitochondria together with the appearance of abundant testis-specific Tfam mRNA isoforms as spermatogenesis proceeds in both mouse and man. Interestingly, an abundant testis-specific nuclear Tfam protein isoform of unknown function is found in the mouse, but not in humans. We have now characterized Tfam expression in rat testis to identify conserved features in mammalian spermatogenesis. The nuclear Tfam protein isoform is absent in the rat and is thus dispensable for mammalian spermatogenesis. Similar to mice and humans, we found expression of alternate Tfam transcripts, downregulation of mitochondrial Tfam protein levels, and downregulation of mtDNA copy number during rat spermatogenesis. These features are thus common to all mammals and may provide one of several mechanisms preventing paternal mtDNA transmission.

%X Eukaryotic AAA proteases form a conserved family of membrane-embedded ATP-dependent proteases but have been analyzed functionally only in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we have identified two novel members of this protein family in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, which were termed MAP-1 and IAP-1. Both proteins are localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria. They are part of two similar-sized high molecular mass complexes, but expose their catalytic sites to opposite membrane surfaces, namely, the intermembrane and the matrix space. Disruption of iap-1 by repeat-induced point mutation caused a slow growth phenotype at high temperature and stabilization of a misfolded inner membrane protein against degradation. IAP-1 could partially substitute for functions of its yeast homolog Yme1, demonstrating functional conservation. However, respiratory growth at 37 degrees C was not restored. Our results identify two components of the quality control system of the mitochondrial inner membrane in N. crassa and suggest that AAA proteases with catalytic sites exposed to opposite membrane surfaces are present in mitochondria of all eukaryotic cells.

%X The molecular chaperone protein Hsp78, a member of the Clp/Hsp100 family localized in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is required for maintenance of mitochondrial functions under heat stress. To characterize the biochemical mechanisms of Hsp78 function, Hsp78 was purified to homogeneity and its role in the reactivation of chemically and heat-denatured substrate protein was analyzed in vitro. Hsp78 alone was not able to mediate reactivation of firefly luciferase. Rather, efficient refolding was dependent on the simultaneous presence of Hsp78 and the mitochondrial Hsp70 machinery, composed of Ssc1p/Mdj1p/Mge1p. Bacterial DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, which cooperates with the Hsp78 homolog, ClpB in Escherichia coli, could not substitute for the mitochondrial Hsp70 system. However, efficient Hsp78-dependent refolding of luciferase was observed if DnaK was replaced by Ssc1p in these experiments, suggesting a specific functional interaction of both chaperone proteins. These findings establish the cooperation of Hsp78 with the Hsp70 machinery in the refolding of heat-inactivated proteins and demonstrate a conserved mode of action of ClpB homologs.

%X The nuclear genome is physically compacted during spermatogenesis by replacing histones with protamines and transition proteins. This altered nuclear protein context may make gene regulation at the transcriptional level less efficient and could explain why post-transcriptional regulation is prominent in haploid male germ cells. Mitochondria and mitochondrial (mt) DNA are maternally inherited, whereas the transmission of paternal mtDNA is blocked in mammals. The paternal mtDNA enters the oocyte but is no longer detectable in the preimplantation embryo. Several mechanisms could be responsible for preventing the transmission of paternal mtDNA, including the down-regulation of mtDNA copy number during spermatogenesis, specific elimination of paternal mitochondria in fertilized oocytes, and the suspension of mtDNA replication in the fertilized oocyte. It is the first of these that is the subject of the present review. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA, or Tfam) is a key regulator of mtDNA copy number in mammals. Germ cell-specific Tfam transcript isoforms are expressed during spermatogenesis in mice and humans. These alternative Tfam transcript isoforms have a structure that could prevent protein translation; their expression coincides with down-regulation of the mitochondrial Tfam protein values. We propose that this down-regulation of mitochondrial Tfam protein levels in turn down-regulates mtDNA copy number during mammalian spermatogenesis.

%X The biogenesis of mitochondria and the maintenance of mitochondrial functions depends on an autonomous proteolytic system in the organelle which is highly conserved throughout evolution. Components of this system include processing peptidases and ATP-dependent proteases, as well as molecular chaperone proteins and protein complexes with apparently regulatory functions. While processing peptidases mediate maturation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial preproteins, quality control within various subcompartments of mitochondria is ensured by ATP-dependent proteases which selectively remove non-assembled or misfolded polypeptides. Moreover; these proteases appear to control the activity- or steady-state levels of specific regulatory proteins and thereby ensure mitochondrial genome integrity, gene expression and protein assembly.

%X The proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells requires communication with the lymphoid organ microenvironment. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a multifunctional intracellular adaptor protein that transmits extracellular signals to regulate malignant cell motility, metastasis, and cell-cycle progression, but is poorly characterized in hematologic malignancies. In this study, we investigated the role of ILK in the context of CLL and observed high ILK expression in patient samples, particularly in tumor cells harboring prognostic high-risk markers such as unmutated IGHV genes, high Zap70, or CD38 expression, or a signature of recent proliferation. We also found increased numbers of Ki67 (MKI67)-positive cells in regions of enhanced ILK expression in lymph nodes from CLL patients. Using coculture conditions mimicking the proliferative lymph node microenvironment, we detected a parallel induction of ILK and cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression in CLL cells that was dependent on the activation of NF-kappaB signaling by soluble TNFalpha. The newly synthesized ILK protein colocalized to centrosomal structures and was required for correct centrosome clustering and mitotic spindle organization. Furthermore, we established a mouse model of CLL in which B-cell-specific genetic ablation of ILK resulted in decelerated leukemia development due to reduced organ infiltration and proliferation of CLL cells. Collectively, our findings describe a TNFalpha-NF-kappaB-mediated mechanism by which ILK expression is induced in the lymph node microenvironment and propose that ILK promotes leukemogenesis by enabling CLL cells to cope with centrosomal defects acquired during malignant transformation.

%X Glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) mutations are associated with Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by functional deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosylceramide to ceramide and glucose. Neuronopathic forms of GD can be associated with rapid neurological decline (Type II) or manifest as a chronic form (Type III) with a wide spectrum of neurological signs. Furthermore, there is now a well-established link between GBA1 mutations and Parkinson's disease (PD), with heterozygote mutations in GBA1 considered the commonest genetic defect in PD. Here we describe a novel Drosophila model of GD that lacks the two fly GBA1 orthologs. This knock-out model recapitulates the main features of GD at the cellular level with severe lysosomal defects and accumulation of glucosylceramide in the fly brain. We also demonstrate a block in autophagy flux in association with reduced lifespan, age-dependent locomotor deficits and accumulation of autophagy substrates in dGBA-deficient fly brains. Furthermore, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is downregulated in dGBA knock-out flies, with a concomitant upregulation of Mitf gene expression, the fly ortholog of mammalian TFEB, likely as a compensatory response to the autophagy block. Moreover, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is able to partially ameliorate the lifespan, locomotor, and oxidative stress phenotypes. Together, our results demonstrate that this dGBA1-deficient fly model is a useful platform for the further study of the role of lysosomal-autophagic impairment and the potential therapeutic benefits of rapamycin in neuronopathic GD. These results also have important implications for the role of autophagy and mTOR signaling in GBA1-associated PD SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We developed a Drosophila model of neuronopathic GD by knocking-out the fly orthologs of the GBA1 gene, demonstrating abnormal lysosomal pathology in the fly brain. Functioning lysosomes are required for autophagosome-lysosomal fusion in the autophagy pathway. We show in vivo that autophagy is impaired in dGBA-deficient fly brains. In response, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity is downregulated in dGBA-deficient flies and rapamycin ameliorates the lifespan, locomotor, and oxidative stress phenotypes. dGBA knock-out flies also display an upregulation of the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian TFEB, Mitf, a response that is unable to overcome the autophagy block. Together, our results suggest that rapamycin may have potential benefits in the treatment of GD, as well as PD linked to GBA1 mutations.

%X The TOR and Insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) network controls growth, metabolism and ageing. Although reducing TOR or insulin signalling can be beneficial for ageing, it can be detrimental for wound healing, but the reasons for this difference are unknown. Here we show that IIS is activated in the cells surrounding an epidermal wound in Drosophila melanogaster larvae, resulting in PI3K activation and redistribution of the transcription factor FOXO. Insulin and TOR signalling are independently necessary for normal wound healing, with FOXO and S6K as their respective effectors. IIS is specifically required in cells surrounding the wound, and the effect is independent of glycogen metabolism. Insulin signalling is needed for the efficient assembly of an actomyosin cable around the wound, and constitutively active myosin II regulatory light chain suppresses the effects of reduced IIS. These findings may have implications for the role of insulin signalling and FOXO activation in diabetic wound healing.

%X The cannabinoid type 1 receptor (Cnr1, CB1R) mediates a plethora of physiological functions in the central nervous system as a presynaptic modulator of neurotransmitter release. The recently identified cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein 1a (Cnrip1a, CRIP1a) binds to the C-terminal domain of CB1R, a region known to be important for receptor desensitization and internalization. Evidence that CRIP1a and CB1R interact in vivo has been reported, but the neuroanatomical distribution of CRIP1a is unknown. Moreover, while alterations of hippocampal CRIP1a levels following limbic seizures indicate a role in controlling excessive neuronal activity, the physiological function of CRIP1a in vivo has not been investigated. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution of CRIP1a in the hippocampus and examined CRIP1a as a potential modulator of CB1R signaling. We found that Cnrip1a mRNA is co-expressed with Cnr1 mRNA in pyramidal neurons and interneurons of the hippocampal formation. CRIP1a protein profiles were largely segregated from CB1R profiles in mossy cell terminals but not in hippocampal CA1 region. CB1R activation induced relocalization to close proximity with CRIP1a. Adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of CRIP1a specifically in the hippocampus revealed that CRIP1a modulates CB1R activity by enhancing cannabinoid-induced G protein activation. CRIP1a overexpression extended the depression of excitatory currents by cannabinoids in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and diminished the severity of chemically induced acute epileptiform seizures. Collectively, our data indicate that CRIP1a enhances hippocampal CB1R signaling in vivo.

%X The quest to extend healthspan via pharmacological means is becoming increasingly urgent, both from a health and economic perspective. Here we show that lithium, a drug approved for human use, promotes longevity and healthspan. We demonstrate that lithium extends lifespan in female and male Drosophila, when administered throughout adulthood or only later in life. The life-extending mechanism involves the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF-2). Combining genetic loss of the NRF-2 repressor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) with lithium treatment revealed that high levels of NRF-2 activation conferred stress resistance, while low levels additionally promoted longevity. The discovery of GSK-3 as a therapeutic target for aging will likely lead to more effective treatments that can modulate mammalian aging and further improve health in later life.

%X Lifespan of laboratory animals can be increased by genetic, pharmacological, and dietary interventions. Increased expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, together with resistance to xenobiotics, are frequent correlates of lifespan extension in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila, and mice. The Green Theory of Aging suggests that this association is causal, with the ability of cells to rid themselves of lipophilic toxins limiting normal lifespan. To test this idea, we experimentally increased resistance of Drosophila to the xenobiotic dichlordiphenyltrichlorethan (DDT), by artificial selection or by transgenic expression of a gene encoding a cytochrome P450. Although both interventions increased DDT resistance, neither increased lifespan. Furthermore, dietary restriction increased lifespan without increasing xenobiotic resistance, confirming that the two traits can be uncoupled. Reduced activity of the insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) pathway increases resistance to xenobiotics and extends lifespan in Drosophila, and can also increase longevity in C. elegans, mice, and possibly humans. We identified a nuclear hormone receptor, DHR96, as an essential mediator of the increased xenobiotic resistance of IIS mutant flies. However, the IIS mutants remained long-lived in the absence of DHR96 and the xenobiotic resistance that it conferred. Thus, in Drosophila IIS mutants, increased xenobiotic resistance and enhanced longevity are not causally connected. The frequent co-occurrence of the two traits may instead have evolved because, in nature, lowered IIS can signal the presence of pathogens. It will be important to determine whether enhanced xenobiotic metabolism is also a correlated, rather than a causal, trait in long-lived mice.

%X Germline removal provokes longevity in several species and shifts resources towards survival and repair. Several Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factors regulate longevity arising from germline removal; yet, how they work together is unknown. Here we identify a Myc-like HLH transcription factor network comprised of Mondo/Max-like complex (MML-1/MXL-2) to be required for longevity induced by germline removal, as well as by reduced TOR, insulin/IGF signalling and mitochondrial function. Germline removal increases MML-1 nuclear accumulation and activity. Surprisingly, MML-1 regulates nuclear localization and activity of HLH-30/TFEB, a convergent regulator of autophagy, lysosome biogenesis and longevity, by downregulating TOR signalling via LARS-1/leucyl-transfer RNA synthase. HLH-30 also upregulates MML-1 upon germline removal. Mammalian MondoA/B and TFEB show similar mutual regulation. MML-1/MXL-2 and HLH-30 transcriptomes show both shared and preferential outputs including MDL-1/MAD-like HLH factor required for longevity. These studies reveal how an extensive interdependent HLH transcription factor network distributes responsibility and mutually enforces states geared towards reproduction or survival.

%X Human ageing is a fundamental biological process that leads to functional decay, increased risk for various diseases and, ultimately, death. Some of the basic biological mechanisms underlying human ageing are shared with other organisms; thus, animal models have been invaluable in providing key mechanistic and molecular insights into the common bases of biological ageing. In this Review, we briefly summarise the major applications of the most commonly used model organisms adopted in ageing research and highlight their relevance in understanding human ageing. We compare the strengths and limitations of different model organisms and discuss in detail an emerging ageing model, the short-lived African turquoise killifish. We review the recent progress made in using the turquoise killifish to study the biology of ageing and discuss potential future applications of this promising animal model.

%X Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a regulator of growth in many tissues, mediates its activity through two multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 or mTORC2. The role of mTOR signalling in skin morphogenesis and epidermal development is unknown. Here we identify mTOR as an essential regulator in skin morphogenesis by epidermis-specific deletion of Mtor in mice (mTOREKO). mTOREKO mutants are viable, but die shortly after birth due to deficits primarily during the early epidermal differentiation programme and lack of a protective barrier development. Epidermis-specific loss of Raptor, which encodes an essential component of mTORC1, confers the same skin phenotype as seen in mTOREKO mutants. In contrast, newborns with an epidermal deficiency of Rictor, an essential component of mTORC2, survive despite a hypoplastic epidermis and disruption in late stage terminal differentiation. These findings highlight a fundamental role for mTOR in epidermal morphogenesis that is regulated by distinct functions for mTORC1 and mTORC2.

%X mTORC1 promotes cell growth and is therefore inactivated upon unfavourable growth conditions. Signalling pathways downstream of most cellular stresses converge on TSC1/2, which serves as an integration point that inhibits mTORC1. The TSC1/2 complex was shown to translocate to lysosomes to inactivate mTORC1 in response to two stresses: amino-acid starvation and growth factor removal. Whether other stresses also regulate TSC2 localization is not known. How TSC2 localization responds to combinations of stresses and other stimuli is also unknown. We show that both amino acids and growth factors are required simultaneously to maintain TSC2 cytoplasmic; when one of the two is missing, TSC2 relocalizes to lysosomes. Furthermore, multiple different stresses that inhibit mTORC1 also drive TSC2 lysosomal accumulation. Our findings indicate that lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 is a universal response to stimuli that inactivate mTORC1, and that the presence of any single stress is sufficient to cause TSC2 lysosomal localization.

%X Mutations of mtDNA are an important cause of human disease, but few animal models exist. Because mammalian mitochondria cannot be transfected, the development of mice with pathogenic mtDNA mutations has been challenging, and the main strategy has therefore been to introduce mutations found in cell lines into mouse embryos. Here, we describe a phenotype-driven strategy that is based on detecting clonal expansion of pathogenic mtDNA mutations in colonic crypts of founder mice derived from heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice. As proof of concept, we report the generation of a mouse line transmitting a heteroplasmic pathogenic mutation in the alanine tRNA gene of mtDNA displaying typical characteristics of classic mitochondrial disease. In summary, we describe a straightforward and technically simple strategy based on mouse breeding and histology to generate animal models of mtDNA-mutation disease, which will be of great importance for studies of disease pathophysiology and preclinical treatment trials.

%X About two-thirds of the vital genes in the Drosophila genome are involved in eye development, making the fly eye an excellent genetic system to study cellular function and development, neurodevelopment/degeneration, and complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. We developed a novel computational method, implemented as Flynotyper software (http://flynotyper.sourceforge.net), to quantitatively assess the morphological defects in the Drosophila eye resulting from genetic alterations affecting basic cellular and developmental processes. Flynotyper utilizes a series of image processing operations to automatically detect the fly eye and the individual ommatidium, and calculates a phenotypic score as a measure of the disorderliness of ommatidial arrangement in the fly eye. As a proof of principle, we tested our method by analyzing the defects due to eye-specific knockdown of Drosophila orthologs of 12 neurodevelopmental genes to accurately document differential sensitivities of these genes to dosage alteration. We also evaluated eye images from six independent studies assessing the effect of overexpression of repeats, candidates from peptide library screens, and modifiers of neurotoxicity and developmental processes on eye morphology, and show strong concordance with the original assessment. We further demonstrate the utility of this method by analyzing 16 modifiers of sine oculis obtained from two genome-wide deficiency screens of Drosophila and accurately quantifying the effect of its enhancers and suppressors during eye development. Our method will complement existing assays for eye phenotypes, and increase the accuracy of studies that use fly eyes for functional evaluation of genes and genetic interactions.

%X Proteolytic cleavage of the dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatase OPA1 in mitochondria is emerging as a central regulatory hub that determines mitochondrial morphology under stress and in disease. Stress-induced OPA1 processing by OMA1 triggersmitochondrial fragmentation, which is associated with mitophagy and apoptosis in vitro. Here, we identify OMA1 as a critical regulator of neuronal survival in vivo and demonstrate that stress-induced OPA1 processing by OMA1 promotes neuronal death and neuroinflammatory responses. Using mice lacking prohibitin membrane scaffolds as a model of neurodegeneration, we demonstrate that additional ablation of Oma1 delays neuronal loss and prolongs lifespan. This is accompanied by the accumulation of fusion-active, long OPA1 forms, which stabilize the mitochondrial genome but do not preserve mitochondrial cristae or respiratory chain supercomplex assembly in prohibitin-depleted neurons. Thus, long OPA1 forms can promote neuronal survival independently of cristae shape, whereas stress-induced OMA1 activation and OPA1 cleavage limit mitochondrial fusion and promote neuronal death.

%X Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 proteins that are essential for the function of the oxidative phosphorylation system, which is composed of four respiratory-chain complexes and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase. Remarkably, the maintenance and expression of mtDNA depend on the mitochondrial import of hundreds of nuclear-encoded proteins that control genome maintenance, replication, transcription, RNA maturation, and mitochondrial translation. The importance of this complex regulatory system is underscored by the identification of numerous mutations of nuclear genes that impair mtDNA maintenance and expression at different levels, causing human mitochondrial diseases with pleiotropic clinical manifestations. The basic scientific understanding of the mechanisms controlling mtDNA function has progressed considerably during the past few years, thanks to advances in biochemistry, genetics, and structural biology. The challenges for the future will be to understand how mtDNA maintenance and expression are regulated and to what extent direct intramitochondrial cross talk between different processes, such as transcription and translation, is important.

%X The regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by the GTPase OPA1, which is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane, is crucial for adapting mitochondrial function and preserving cellular health. OPA1 governs the delicate balance between fusion and fission in the dynamic mitochondrial network. A disturbance of this balance, often observed under stress and pathologic conditions, causes mitochondrial fragmentation and can ultimately result in cell death. As discussed in this Commentary, these morphological changes are regulated by proteolytic processing of OPA1 by the inner-membrane peptidases YME1L (also known as YME1L1) and OMA1. Long, membrane-bound forms of OPA1 are required for mitochondrial fusion, but their processing to short, soluble forms limits fusion and can facilitate mitochondrial fission. Excessive OPA1 processing by the stress-activated protease OMA1 promotes mitochondrial fragmentation and, if persistent, triggers cell death and tissue degeneration in vivo The prevention of OMA1-mediated OPA1 processing and mitochondrial fragmentation might thus offer exciting therapeutic potential for human diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

%X BACKGROUND: Cell survival critically depends on the integrity of mitochondria, which play a pivotal role during apoptosis. Extensive mitochondrial damage promotes release of pro-apoptotic factors from the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Released mitochondrial proteins include Smac/DIABLO and HTRA2/Omi, which inhibit the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase XIAP and other inhibitors of apoptosis proteins. AIMS: Here we investigated the cause of extreme hypertonia at birth, alternating with hypotonia, with the subsequent appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms, lack of psychomotor development, microcephaly, intractable seizures and early death in four patients from two unrelated families. The patients showed lactic acidemia, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, intermittent neutropenia, evolving brain atrophy and disturbed cristae structure in muscle mitochondria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified missplicing mutation and a 5 bp deletion in HTRA2, encoding HTRA2/Omi. This protein was completely absent from the patients' fibroblasts, whose growth was impaired and which were hypersensitive to apoptosis. Expression of HtrA2/Omi or of the proteolytically inactive HTRA2/Omi protein restored the cells' apoptotic resistance. However, cell growth was only restored by the proteolytically active protein. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of recessive deleterious mutations in HTRA2 in human. The clinical phenotype, the increased apoptotic susceptibility and the impaired cell growth recapitulate those observed in the Htra2 knockout mice and in mutant mice with proteolytically inactive HTRA2/Omi. Together, they underscore the importance of both chaperone and proteolytic activities of HTRA2/Omi for balanced apoptosis sensitivity and for brain development. Absence of HTRA2/Omi is associated with severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, abnormal mitochondria, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and increased sensitivity to apoptosis.

%X Mitochondria exert critical functions in cellular lipid metabolism and promote the synthesis of major constituents of cellular membranes, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine. Here, we demonstrate that the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase Psd1, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, promotes mitochondrial PE synthesis via two pathways. First, Ups2-Mdm35 complexes (SLMO2-TRIAP1 in humans) serve as phosphatidylserine (PS)-specific lipid transfer proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, allowing formation of PE by Psd1 in the inner membrane. Second, Psd1 decarboxylates PS in the outer membrane in trans, independently of PS transfer by Ups2-Mdm35. This latter pathway requires close apposition between both mitochondrial membranes and the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS). In MICOS-deficient cells, limiting PS transfer by Ups2-Mdm35 and reducing mitochondrial PE accumulation preserves mitochondrial respiration and cristae formation. These results link mitochondrial PE metabolism to MICOS, combining functions in protein and lipid homeostasis to preserve mitochondrial structure and function.

%X The recognition and translation of mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs are poorly understood. To gain further insights into these processes in vivo, we characterized mice with a missense mutation that causes loss of the translational activator of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (TACO1). We report that TACO1 is not required for embryonic survival, although the mutant mice have substantially reduced COXI protein, causing an isolated complex IV deficiency. We show that TACO1 specifically binds the mt-Co1 mRNA and is required for translation of COXI through its association with the mitochondrial ribosome. We determined the atomic structure of TACO1, revealing three domains in the shape of a hook with a tunnel between domains 1 and 3. Mutations in the positively charged domain 1 reduce RNA binding by TACO1. The Taco1 mutant mice develop a late-onset visual impairment, motor dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy and thus provide a useful model for future treatment trials for mitochondrial disease.

%X Fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) has emerged as a potential plasma marker to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To study the molecular processes underlying the association of plasma Fgf21 with NAFLD, we explored the liver transcriptome data of a mild NAFLD model of aging C57BL/6J mice at 12, 24, and 28 months of age. The plasma Fgf21 level significantly correlated with intrahepatic triglyceride content. At the molecular level, elevated plasma Fgf21 levels were associated with dysregulated metabolic and cancer-related pathways. The up-regulated Fgf21 levels in NAFLD were implied to be a protective response against the NAFLD-induced adverse effects, e.g. lipotoxicity, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. An in vivo PPARalpha challenge demonstrated the dysregulation of PPARalpha signalling in the presence of NAFLD, which resulted in a stochastically increasing hepatic expression of Fgf21. Notably, elevated plasma Fgf21 was associated with declining expression of Klb, Fgf21's crucial co-receptor, which suggests a resistance to Fgf21. Therefore, although liver fat accumulation is a benign stage of NAFLD, the elevated plasma Fgf21 likely indicated vulnerability to metabolic stressors that may contribute towards progression to end-stage NAFLD. In conclusion, plasma levels of Fgf21 reflect liver fat accumulation and dysregulation of metabolic pathways in the liver.

%X Mitochondriopathies often present clinically as multisystemic disorders of primarily high-energy consuming organs. Assembly, turnover, and surveillance of mitochondrial proteins are essential for mitochondrial function and a key task of AAA family members of metalloproteases. We identified a homozygous mutation in the nuclear encoded mitochondrial escape 1-like 1 gene YME1L1, member of the AAA protease family, as a cause of a novel mitochondriopathy in a consanguineous pedigree of Saudi Arabian descent. The homozygous missense mutation, located in a highly conserved region in the mitochondrial pre-sequence, inhibits cleavage of YME1L1 by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, which culminates in the rapid degradation of YME1L1 precursor protein. Impaired YME1L1 function causes a proliferation defect and mitochondrial network fragmentation due to abnormal processing of OPA1. Our results identify mutations in YME1L1 as a cause of a mitochondriopathy with optic nerve atrophy highlighting the importance of YME1L1 for mitochondrial functionality in humans.

%X The regulation of mitochondrial RNA processing and its importance for ribosome biogenesis and energy metabolism are not clear. We generated conditional knockout mice of the endoribonuclease component of the RNase P complex, MRPP3, and report that it is essential for life and that heart and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout leads to severe cardiomyopathy, indicating that its activity is non-redundant. Transcriptome-wide parallel analyses of RNA ends (PARE) and RNA-seq enabled us to identify that in vivo 5' tRNA cleavage precedes 3' tRNA processing, and this is required for the correct biogenesis of the mitochondrial ribosomal subunits. We identify that mitoribosomal biogenesis proceeds co-transcriptionally because large mitoribosomal proteins can form a subcomplex on an unprocessed RNA containing the 16S rRNA. Taken together, our data show that RNA processing links transcription to translation via assembly of the mitoribosome.

%X Mitochondria are vital in providing cellular energy via their oxidative phosphorylation system, which requires the coordinated expression of genes encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). Transcription of the circular mammalian mtDNA depends on a single mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT). Although the transcription initiation process is well understood, it is debated whether POLRMT also serves as the primase for the initiation of mtDNA replication. In the nucleus, the RNA polymerases needed for gene expression have no such role. Conditional knockout of Polrmt in the heart results in severe mitochondrial dysfunction causing dilated cardiomyopathy in young mice. We further studied the molecular consequences of different expression levels of POLRMT and found that POLRMT is essential for primer synthesis to initiate mtDNA replication in vivo. Furthermore, transcription initiation for primer formation has priority over gene expression. Surprisingly, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) exists in an mtDNA-free pool in the Polrmt knockout mice. TFAM levels remain unchanged despite strong mtDNA depletion, and TFAM is thus protected from degradation of the AAA(+) Lon protease in the absence of POLRMT. Last, we report that mitochondrial transcription elongation factor may compensate for a partial depletion of POLRMT in heterozygous Polrmt knockout mice, indicating a direct regulatory role of this factor in transcription. In conclusion, we present in vivo evidence that POLRMT has a key regulatory role in the replication of mammalian mtDNA and is part of a transcriptional mechanism that provides a switch between primer formation for mtDNA replication and mitochondrial gene expression.

%X Mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes I, III, and IV associate into a variety of supramolecular structures known as supercomplexes and respirasomes. While COX7A2L was originally described as a supercomplex-specific factor responsible for the dynamic association of complex IV into these structures to adapt MRC function to metabolic variations, this role has been disputed. Here, we further examine the functional significance of COX7A2L in the structural organization of the mammalian respiratory chain. As in the mouse, human COX7A2L binds primarily to free mitochondrial complex III and, to a minor extent, to complex IV to specifically promote the stabilization of the III2+IV supercomplex without affecting respirasome formation. Furthermore, COX7A2L does not affect the biogenesis, stabilization, and function of the individual oxidative phosphorylation complexes. These data show that independent regulatory mechanisms for the biogenesis and turnover of different MRC supercomplex structures co-exist.

%X Components of the type II CRISPR-Cas complex in bacteria have been used successfully in eukaryotic cells to facilitate rapid and accurate cell line engineering, animal model generation and functional genomic screens. Such developments are providing new opportunities for drug target identification and validation, particularly with the application of pooled genetic screening. As CRISPR-Cas is a relatively new genetic screening tool, it is important to assess its functionality in a number of different cell lines and to analyse potential improvements that might increase the sensitivity of a given screen. To examine critical aspects of screening quality, we constructed ultra-complex libraries containing sgRNA sequences targeting a collection of essential genes. We examined the performance of screening in both haploid and hypotriploid cell lines, using two alternative guide design algorithms and two tracrRNA variants in a time-resolved analysis. Our data indicate that a simple adaptation of the tracrRNA substantially improves the robustness of guide loss during a screen. This modification minimises the requirement for high numbers of sgRNAs targeting each gene, increasing hit scoring and creating a powerful new platform for successful screening.

%X Mutations of mtDNA are an important cause of human disease, but few animal models exist. Because mammalian mitochondria cannot be transfected, the development of mice with pathogenic mtDNA mutations has been challenging, and the main strategy has therefore been to introduce mutations found in cell lines into mouse embryos. Here, we describe a phenotype-driven strategy that is based on detecting clonal expansion of pathogenic mtDNA mutations in colonic crypts of founder mice derived from heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice. As proof of concept, we report the generation of a mouse line transmitting a heteroplasmic pathogenic mutation in the alanine tRNA gene of mtDNA displaying typical characteristics of classic mitochondrial disease. In summary, we describe a straightforward and technically simple strategy based on mouse breeding and histology to generate animal models of mtDNA-mutation disease, which will be of great importance for studies of disease pathophysiology and preclinical treatment trials.

%X ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification that can alter the physical and chemical properties of target proteins and that controls many important cellular processes. Macrodomains are evolutionarily conserved structural domains that bind ADP-ribose derivatives and are found in proteins with diverse cellular functions. Some proteins from the macrodomain family can hydrolyze ADP-ribosylated substrates and therefore reverse this post-translational modification. Bacteria and Streptomyces, in particular, are known to utilize protein ADP-ribosylation, yet very little is known about their enzymes that synthesize and remove this modification. We have determined the crystal structure and characterized, both biochemically and functionally, the macrodomain protein SCO6735 from Streptomyces coelicolor This protein is a member of an uncharacterized subfamily of macrodomain proteins. Its crystal structure revealed a highly conserved macrodomain fold. We showed that SCO6735 possesses the ability to hydrolyze PARP-dependent protein ADP-ribosylation. Furthermore, we showed that expression of this protein is induced upon DNA damage and that deletion of this protein in S. coelicolor increases antibiotic production. Our results provide the first insights into the molecular basis of its action and impact on Streptomyces metabolism.

%X Mutations in subunits of mitochondrial m-AAA proteases in the inner membrane cause neurodegeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA28) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP7). m-AAA proteases preserve mitochondrial proteostasis, mitochondrial morphology, and efficient OXPHOS activity, but the cause for neuronal loss in disease is unknown. We have determined the neuronal interactome of m-AAA proteases in mice and identified a complex with C2ORF47 (termed MAIP1), which counteracts cell death by regulating the assembly of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter MCU. While MAIP1 assists biogenesis of the MCU subunit EMRE, the m-AAA protease degrades non-assembled EMRE and ensures efficient assembly of gatekeeper subunits with MCU. Loss of the m-AAA protease results in accumulation of constitutively active MCU-EMRE channels lacking gatekeeper subunits in neuronal mitochondria and facilitates mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and neuronal death. Together, our results explain neuronal loss in m-AAA protease deficiency by deregulated mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis.

%X Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) synthesize a critical set of proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, mitoribosomal function is vital to the cellular energy supply. Mitoribosome biogenesis follows distinct molecular pathways that remain poorly understood. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structures of mitoribosomes isolated from human cell lines with either depleted or overexpressed mitoribosome assembly factor GTPBP5, allowing us to capture consecutive steps during mitoribosomal large subunit (mt-LSU) biogenesis. Our structures provide essential insights into the last steps of 16S rRNA folding, methylation and peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) completion, which require the coordinated action of nine assembly factors. We show that mammalian-specific MTERF4 contributes to the folding of 16S rRNA, allowing 16 S rRNA methylation by MRM2, while GTPBP5 and NSUN4 promote fine-tuning rRNA rearrangements leading to PTC formation. Moreover, our data reveal an unexpected involvement of the elongation factor mtEF-Tu in mt-LSU assembly, where mtEF-Tu interacts with GTPBP5, similar to its interaction with tRNA during translational elongation.

%X Two AAA proteases, each with its catalytic site at the opposite membrane surface, mediate the ATP-dependent degradation of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins. We demonstrate here that a model substrate polypeptide containing hydrophilic domains at both sides of the membrane can be completely degraded by either of the AAA proteases, if solvent-exposed domains are in an unfolded state. A short protein tail protruding from the membrane surface is sufficient to allow the proteolytic attack of an AAA protease that facilitates domain unfolding at the opposite side. Our results provide a rationale for the membrane arrangement of AAA proteases in mitochondria and demonstrate that degradation of membrane proteins by AAA proteases involves an active extraction of transmembrane segments and transport of solvent-exposed domains across the membrane.

%X The daf-12 gene acts at the convergence of pathways regulating larval diapause, developmental age, and adult longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. It encodes a nuclear receptor most closely related to two C. elegans receptors, NHR-8 and NHR-48, Drosophila DHR96, and vertebrate vitamin D and pregnane-X receptors. daf-12 has three predicted protein isoforms, two of which contain DNA- and ligand-binding domains, and one of which contains the ligand-binding domain only. Mutations cluster in DNA- and ligand-binding domains, but correspond to distinct phenotypic classes. DAF-12 is expressed widely in target tissues from embryo to adult, but is upregulated during midlarval stages. In the adult, expression persists in nervous system and somatic gonad, two tissues that regulate adult longevity. We propose that DAF-12 integrates hormonal signals in cellular targets to coordinate major life history traits.

%X Single large mitochondrial DNA deletions (DeltamtDNA) are usually spontaneously occurring and cause a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from severe infantile multisystem disorders to adult onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). There is always heteroplasmy with a mixture of normal and mutant mtDNA and the levels usually vary widely between tissues. There is at present insufficient scientific basis for accurate genetic counselling of women with DeltamtDNA, but it is reasonable to assume that DeltamtDNA can be transmitted if it is present in the female germ cells. Here, we present the results of prenatal analysis in a woman with DeltamtDNA and PEO. No DeltamtDNA was detected by Southern blot and PCR analyses of chorionic villi from the first trimester of pregnancy, in cord blood obtained at birth or in peripheral blood from the child at six months of age. This makes it unlikely that the child will develop a severe infantile mitochondrial disorder due to transmission of high levels of DeltamtDNA. However, the complex mitochondrial genetics and the limited access to human tissues makes it impossible to exclude transmission of low levels of DeltamtDNA that possibly could cause disease later in life.

%X AAA proteases are a conserved class of ATP-dependent proteases that mediate the degradation of membrane proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. They combine proteolytic and chaperone-like activities and thus form a membrane-integrated quality-control system. Inactivation of AAA proteases causes severe defects in various organisms, including neurodegeneration in humans. Proteolysis by AAA proteases is modulated by another membrane-protein complex that is composed of prohibitins in eukaryotic cells and related proteins in bacteria.

%X Tcm62p, distantly related to chaperonins, is required for the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase in mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was proposed to exert chaperone activity. We demonstrate here crucial functions of Tcm62p under heat stress. It ensures mitochondrial gene expression at elevated temperatures and prevents heat-aggregation of the ribosomal subunit Var1p. Similar to chaperonins, Tcm62p forms a high molecular mass protein complex of approximately 850 kDa in the mitochondrial matrix space. These results suggest a more general chaperone function of Tcm62p in mitochondria.

%X We recently described a mouse model that reproduces important pathophysiological features of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation diseases. The gene for mouse mitochondrial transcription factor A, Tfam (also called mtTFA), a nucleus-encoded key regulator of mtDNA expression, was targeted with loxP sites (Tfam(loxP)) and disrupted in vivo by transgenic expression of cre-recombinase from the muscle creatinine kinase (Ckmm) promoter. This promoter is active from embryonic day 13, and the knockouts had normal respiratory chain function in the heart at birth and developed mitochondrial cardiomyopathy postnatally. In this paper, we describe a heart-knockout strain obtained by mating Tfam(loxP) mice to animals expressing cre-recombinase from the alpha-myosin heavy chain (Myhca) promoter. This promoter is active from embryonic day 8, and the knockouts had onset of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy during embryogenesis. The age of onset of cardiac respiratory chain dysfunction can thus be controlled by temporal regulation of cre-recombinase expression. Further characterization demonstrated that approximately 75% of the knockouts died in the neonatal period, whereas, surprisingly, approximately 25% survived for several months before dying from dilated cardiomyopathy with atrioventricular heart conduction blocks. Modifying gene(s) affect the life span of the knockouts, because approximately 95% of the knockout offspring from an intercross of the longer-living knockouts survived the neonatal period. Thus, the tissue-specific knockouts we describe here not only reproduce important pathophysiological features of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy but also provide a powerful system by which to identify modifying genes of potential therapeutic value.

%X Mitochondria contain the respiratory chain enzyme complexes that carry out oxidative phosphorylation and produce the main part of cellular energy in the form of ATP. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential subunits of the respiratory chain and is thus critical for maintaining cellular energy production. The first pathogenic mtDNA mutations were reported in 1988, and today more than 50 disease-causing mtDNA mutations have been identified. In addition, mtDNA mutations have been implicated in ageing and in common disorders such as diabetes mellitus, heart failure and Parkinson's disease. This review will summarize recent advances in the rapidly expanding field of mitochondrial medicine.

The field of mitochondrial medicine has experienced explosive growth during the last decade. More than 50 mtDNA mutations and several nuclear gene mutations have been identified in affected patients. The recent development of animal models will continue the revolution in mitochondrial medicine by facilitating in depth studies of the molecular pathogenesis and development of novel drug and gene therapy strategies for mitochondrial dysfunction. As we enter the next millennium, we can expect mitochondrial medicine to remain a dynamic and rapidly developing field.

%X The AAA domain, a conserved Walker-type ATPase module, is a feature of members of the AAA family of proteins, which are involved in many cellular processes, including vesicular transport, organelle biogenesis, microtubule rearrangement and protein degradation. The function of the AAA domain, however, has not been explained. Membrane-anchored AAA proteases of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells comprise a subfamily of AAA proteins that have metal-dependent peptidase activity and mediate the degradation of non-assembled membrane proteins. Inactivation of an orthologue of this protease family in humans causes neurodegeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia. Here we investigate the AAA domain of the yeast protein Yme1, a subunit of the iota-AAA protease located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. We show that Yme1 senses the folding state of solvent-exposed domains and specifically degrades unfolded membrane proteins. Substrate recognition and binding are mediated by the amino-terminal region of the AAA domain. The purified AAA domain of Yme1 binds unfolded polypeptides and suppresses their aggregation. Our results indicate that the AAA domain of Ymel has a chaperone-like activity and suggest that the AAA domains of other AAA proteins may have a similar function.

%X Yta10p (Afg3p) and Yta12p (Rcal1p), members of the conserved AAA family of ATPases, are subunits of the mitochondrial m-AAA protease, an inner membrane ATP-dependent metallopeptidase. Deletion of YTA10 or YTA12 impairs degradation of non-assembled inner membrane proteins and assembly of respiratory chain complexes. Mutations of the proteolytic sites in either YTA10 or YTA12 have been shown to inhibit proteolysis of membrane-integrated polypeptides but not the respiratory competence of the cells, suggesting additional activities of Yta10p and Yta12p. Here we demonstrate essential proteolytic functions of the m-AAA protease in the biogenesis of the respiratory chain. Cells harbouring proteolytically inactive forms of both Yta10p and Yta12p are respiratory deficient and exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype similar to Deltayta10 and Deltayta12 cells. They show deficiencies in expression of the intron-containing mitochondrial genes COX1 and COB. Splicing of COX1 and COB transcripts is impaired in mitochondria lacking m-AAA protease, whilst transcription and translation can proceed in the absence of Yta10p or Yta12p. The function of the m-AAA protease appears to be confined to introns encoding mRNA maturases. Our results reveal an overlapping substrate specificity of the subunits of the m-AAA protease and explain the impaired assembly of respiratory chain complexes by defects in expression of intron-containing genes in mitochondria lacking m-AAA protease.

%X To analyze protein degradation in mitochondria and the role of molecular chaperone proteins in this process, bovine apocytochrome P450scc was employed as a model protein. When imported into isolated yeast mitochondria, P450scc was mislocalized to the matrix and rapidly degraded. This proteolytic breakdown was mediated by the ATP-dependent PIM1 protease, a Lon-like protease in the mitochondrial matrix, in cooperation with the mtHsp70 system. In addition, a derivative of P450scc was studied to which a heterologous transmembrane region was fused at the amino terminus. This protein became anchored to the inner membrane upon import and was degraded by the membrane-embedded, ATP-dependent m-AAA protease. Again, degradation depended on the mtHsp70 system; it was inhibited at non-permissive temperature in mitochondria carrying temperature-sensitive mutant forms of Ssc1p, Mdj1p, or Mge1p. These results demonstrate overlapping substrate specificities of PIM1 and the m-AAA protease, and they assign a central role to the mtHsp70 system during the degradation of misfolded polypeptides by both proteases.

%X From egg through adult, C. elegans has six life stages including an option for dauer formation and diapause at larval stage L3 in adverse environments. Somatic cells throughout the organism make consistent choices and advance in unison, suggesting a mechanism of coordinate regulation at these stage transitions. Earlier studies showed that daf-12, which encodes a nuclear receptor (W. Yeh, 1991, Doctoral Thesis. University of Missouri-Columbia), regulates dauer formation; epistasis experiments placed daf-12 near the end of the dauer signaling pathway. Here we describe novel daf-12 alleles that reveal a general role in advancing L3 stage programs. In these mutants, somatic cells repeat L2-specific cellular programs of division and migration at the L3 stage; epistasis experiments place daf-12 between lin-14 and lin-28 within the heterochronic pathway. We propose daf-12 and other heterochronic genes provide cellular memories of chronological stage for selecting stage-appropriate developmental programs. Endocrine factors could coordinate these stage transitions and specify developmental alternatives.

%X The regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expression is crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis during development and differentiation. We have disrupted the mouse gene for mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam; formerly known as m-mtTFA) by gene targetting of loxP-sites followed by cre-mediated excision in vivo. Heterozygous knockout mice exhibit reduced mtDNA copy number and respiratory chain deficiency in heart. Homozygous knockout embryos exhibit a severe mtDNA depletion with abolished oxidative phosphorylation. Mutant embryos proceed through implantation and gastrulation, but die prior to embryonic day (E)10.5. Thus, Tfam is the first mammalian protein demonstrated to regulate mtDNA copy number in vivo and is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and embryonic development.

%X Mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) is a key activator of mitochondrial transcription in mammals. It also has a role in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, since transcription generates an RNA primer necessary for initiation of mtDNA replication. In the mouse, testis-specific mtTFA transcripts encode a protein isoform that is imported to the nucleus rather than into mitochondria of spermatocytes and elongating spermatids. We now report molecular characterization of human mtTFA (h-mtTFA) expression in somatic tissues and male germ cells. Similarly to the mouse, analysis of cDNAs and Northern blots identified abundant testis-specific transcript isoforms generated by use of alternate transcription initiation sites. However, unlike the mouse, none of the testis-specific transcripts predicts a nuclear protein isoform, and Western blot analysis identified only the mitochondrial form of h-mtTFA in human testis. Immunohistochemistry and in situ were used to compare the distribution of mtTFA protein, testis-specific mtTFA transcripts, mtDNA and mtRNA in sections of human testis. Our results show that the mtTFA protein and mtDNA exhibit parallel gradients with high levels in undifferentiated male germ cells and low levels or an absence in different male germ cells. Testis-specific transcripts exhibit the opposite pattern, suggesting that in both humans and mice, these testis-specific mtTFA transcripts down-regulate mtTFA protein levels in mammalian mitochondria. Our findings demonstrate that mtTFA does not have a critical role in the nucleus, suggest a mechanism for reducing mtDNA copy number during spermatogenesis and have implications for the understanding of maternal transmission of mtDNA.

%X Various adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent proteases were identified within mitochondria which mediate selective mitochondrial protein degradation and fulfill crucial functions in mitochondrial biogenesis. The matrix-localized PIM1 protease, a homologue of the Escherichia coli Lon protease, is required for respiration and maintenance of mitochondrial genome integrity. Degradation of non-native polypeptides by PIM1 protease depends on the chaperone activity of the mitochondrial Hsp70 system, posing intriguing questions about the relation between the proteolytic system and the folding machinery in mitochondria. The mitochondrial inner membrane harbors two ATP-dependent metallopeptidases, the m- and the i-AAA protease, which expose their catalytic sites to opposite membrane surfaces and cooperate in the degradation of inner membrane proteins. In addition to its proteolytic activity, the m-AAA protease has chaperone-like activity during the assembly of respiratory and ATP-synthase complexes. It constitutes a quality control system in the inner membrane for membrane-embedded protein complexes.

%X Hsp78, a member of the family of Clp/Hsp100 proteins, exerts chaperone functions in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae which overlap with those of mitochondrial Hsp70. In the present study, the role of Hsp78 under extreme stress was analyzed. Whereas deletion of HSP78 does not affect cell growth at temperatures up to 39 decrees C and cellular thermotolerance at 50 degrees C, Hsp78 is crucial for maintenance of respiratory competence and for mitochondrial genome integrity under severe temperature stress (mitochondrial thermotolerance). Mitochondrial protein synthesis is identified as a thermosensitive process. Reactivation of mitochondrial protein synthesis after heat stress depends on the presence of Hsp78, though Hsp78 does not confer protection against heat-inactivation to this process. Hsp78 appears to act in concert with other mitochondrial chaperone proteins since a conditioning pretreatment of the cells to induce the cellular heat shock response is required to maintain mitochondrial functions under severe temperature stress. When expressed in the cytosol, Hsp78 can substitute for the homologous heat shock protein Hsp104 in mediating cellular thermotolerance, suggesting a conserved mode of action of the two proteins. Thus, proteins of the Clp/Hsp100-family located in the cytosol and within mitochondria confer compartment-specific protection against heat damage to the cell.

%X The mechanism of selective protein degradation of membrane proteins in mitochondria has been studied employing a model protein that is subject to rapid proteolysis within the inner membrane. Protein degradation was mediated by two different proteases: (i) the m-AAA protease, a protease complex consisting of multiple copies of the ATP-dependent metallopeptidases Yta1Op (Afg3p) and Yta12p (Rcalp); and (ii) by Ymelp (Ytallp) that also is embedded in the inner membrane. Ymelp, highly homologous to Yta1Op and Yta12p, forms a complex of approximately 850 kDa in the inner membrane and exerts ATP-dependent metallopeptidase activity. While the m-AAA protease exposes catalytic sites to the mitochondrial matrix, Ymelp is active in the intermembrane space. The Ymelp complex was therefore termed 'i-AAA protease'. Analysis of the proteolytic fragments indicated cleavage of the model polypeptide at the inner and outer membrane surface and within the membrane-spanning domain. Thus, two AAA proteases with their catalytic sites on opposite membrane surfaces constitute a novel proteolytic system for the degradation of membrane proteins in mitochondria.

%X Mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) is a key regulator of mammalian mitochondrial DNA transcription. We report here that a testis-specific isoform of mouse mtTFA lacks the mitochondrial targeting sequence and is present in the nucleus of spermatocytes and elongating spermatids, thus representing the first reported mammalian gene encoding protein isoforms targeted for the mitochondria or the nucleus. The presence of the mitochondrial transcriptional activator in the nucleus raises the possibility of a role for this protein in both genetic systems. Mutations in the nuclear mtTFA gene may therefore exhibit phenotypic consequences due to altered function in either or both genetic compartments.

%X The mitochondrial members of the highly conserved AAA family, Yta10p and Yta12p, constitute a membrane-embedded complex of about 850 kDa. As an ATP dependent metallopeptidase (AAA protease), the YTA10-12 complex mediates the degradation of nonassembled inner membrane proteins. In contrast to nucleotide-dependent complex formation and substrate binding, proteolysis of bound polypeptides depends on the hydrolysis of ATP and the metallopeptidase activity of both subunits. Independent of its proteolytic function, the chaperone-like activity of the YTA10-12 complex is required for assembly of the membrane-associated ATP synthase. We propose that proteolytic and chaperone-like activities in the YTA10-12 complex mediate assembly and degradation processes of membrane protein complexes and thereby exert key functions in the maintenance of membrane integrity.

%X A girl, who died at 14 years of age from a rapidly progressive mitochondrial myopathy, was found to be heteroplasmic for a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene at position 3251. A large proportion of muscle fibres contained accumulations of abnormal mitochondria but no cytochrome c oxidase deficient fibres were present. Polarographic and enzymatic measurements on isolated muscle mitochondria revealed a profound isolated complex I deficiency. A high percentage of mutant mtDNA was found in muscle (94%), fibroblasts (93%), brain (90%), liver (80%), and heart (79%). The family was not available for investigation. For genotype to phenotype correlation studies, we investigated the proportion of mutated mtDNA in single muscle fibres of normal appearance and muscle fibres with accumulations of mitochondria. The proportion of mutant mtDNA was 28% (range <0.3%-86%) in normal appearing fibres and 61% (range 15%-88%) in abnormal fibres. The difference in the proportion of mutant mtDNA was highly significant (P < 0.001) between the two groups of fibres.

%X The role of the mitochondrial Hsp70 system in the prevention of heat-induced protein aggregation was studied in isolated mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Firefly luciferase was employed as a thermolabile tester protein. After shift to 40 degrees Celsius transient increase of mt-Hsp70/luciferase complex was observed, which required functional Mdj1p and Mge1p, the mitochondrial homologues of DnaJ and GrpE. The kinetics of luciferase aggregation, however, were not influenced by mutations in either mt-Hsp70 or Mge1p. Only the absence of Mdj1p led to enhanced protein aggregation. Thus, a central role in the transient protection against heat stress is attributed to this mitochondrial DnaJ homologue.

%X Hsp78 is a Clp homologue within mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of HSP78 does not cause any detectable changes in wild type cells, but results in a petite phenotype in the ssc1-3 mutant strain carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of mt-hsp70. When overexpressed in the ssc1-3 mutant strain, hsp78 suppresses the defect in mitochondrial protein import under permissive conditions in vitro and interacts directly with newly imported polypeptide chains. As a molecular chaperone, hsp78 prevents the aggregation of misfolded proteins in the matrix of mitochondria under conditions of impaired mt-hsp70 function. However, unlike misfolded proteins associated with mt-hsp70, hsp78-bound polypeptides are not efficiently degraded by the ATP-dependent PIM1 protease. Thus, hsp78 can partially substitute for mt-hsp70 functions in the assembly of mitochondria and may be part of a salvage pathway if mt-hsp70 is limiting.

%X Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an autoimmune, inflammatory myopathy where morphological changes of muscle, including ragged red fibers, have indicated mitochondrial dysfunction in some muscle fibers. In this study enzyme histochemical analysis showed that cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient muscle fibers were present at a frequency ranging from 0.5 to 5% of the muscle fibers in a series of 20 IBM patients. In age-matched controls, only occasional COX-deficient muscle fibers were present. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of DNA extracted from muscle tissue of the IBM patients showed multiple mtDNA deletions. PCR analysis of isolated, single muscle fibers showed presence of mtDNA with only one type of deletion and deficiency of wild-type mtDNA in each COX-deficient muscle fiber. This finding was supported by results from in situ hybridization using different mtDNA probes on consecutive sections. A 5 kb deletion was identified in all 20 IBM patients. DNA sequencing of the breakpoint region showed that this deletion was the so-called "common deletion." Most but not all of the investigated deletion breakpoints were flanked by direct repeats. COX-deficient fibers were more frequent among fibers with positive immunostaining with antibodies directed toward a regeneration marker, the Leu-19 antigen, than in the entire fiber population. These results show that COX deficiency in muscle fiber segments in IBM is associated with deletions of mtDNA. Clonal expansion of mtDNA with deletions may take place in regenerating muscle fibers following segmental necrosis.

%X An important feature of the mitochondrial genom is the occurrence of heteroplasmy and the possibility for transmission to the offspring of various proportions of wild-type and mutated mtDNA. We have investigated the proportion of the tRNALys A8344G mutation, the tRNALeu(UUR) A3243G mutation, and the ATPase 6 T8993G mutation in patients with MERRF, MELAS, and Leigh's syndrome and their maternal relatives. The level of mutated mtDNA in the offspring of carriers of the tRNALys mutation is correlated to the level in lymphocytes in the mother and seems to be transmitted by an essentially random mechanism where only a few mtDNA copies are founders of the mitochondrial genom in the offspring and the probability that the mutation is not transmitted to the offspring is high when the mothers carriers predominantly wild-type mtDNA. However, we found age-related differences in the distribution of mutated mtDNA in carriers of the tRNALys and tRNALeu mutations, which have to be considered before levels of mutated mtDNA are used for prediction of prognosis and transmission of a disorder.

%X Myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers syndrome (MERRF) is caused by a heteroplasmic mutation at nucleotide 8344 (A8344G) of the tRNA(Lys) gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This mutation impairs mitochondrial protein synthesis and causes a respiratory chain dysfunction. The risk for transmission of the A8344G mutation from mother to child is dependent on the levels of mutated mtDNA in the mother and above a threshold level of 35-40% the mutation is transmitted to all children. The progression of symptoms in MERRF can be explained by a gene dosage effect with accumulation over time of mutated mtDNA. High levels of mutated mtDNA, ultrastructurally abnormal mitochondria, and a clonal deletion on chromosome 6 are found in lipomas associated with MERRF. These findings indicate that there is a respiratory chain dysfunction in the lipomas and that lipomas may be a manifestation of the A8344G mutation.

%X This man with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibres (MERRF) syndrome due to the tRNA(Lys) A-->G(8344) mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) died of bronchopneumonia at 18 years of age. He had progressive clinical symptoms from 6 months of age manifesting as ataxia, myoclonic seizures, and muscle weakness. A post-mortem examination revealed 91-99% mutated mtDNA in all 32 examined tissue samples, including various organs and different brain regions. The brain appeared without macroscopic changes, but microscopic examination showed degeneration with loss of nerve cells and gliosis affecting the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, dentate nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus, cerebellar cortex, and the spinal cord. Skeletal muscle showed cytochrome c oxidase deficient muscle fibres with proliferation of mitochondria. In addition to pathological changes of muscle and brain there were few morphological changes that could be attributed to his mitochondrial disease. These data support the concept that in patients with the tRNA(Lys) A-->G(8344) mutation who are manifesting disease there are high levels of mutated mtDNA in all tissues, but only some tissues and brain regions are vulnerable.

%X This review focuses on mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which are an important cause of mitochondrial disorders in humans and are also associated with common neurodegenerative disorders and aging. The high copy number of mtDNA and its maternal transmission make the inheritance of mtDNA mutations fundamentally different from the Mendelian inheritance of nuclear DNA mutations. There is often a mixture of wild-type and mutated mtDNAs (heteroplasmy), and heterogeneity in the distribution of mutated mtDNAs is one plausible explanation for the widely varying phenotypes in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The application of molecular genetics has led to significant progress in the studies of human mitochondrial disorders in the past decade. Future studies including the development of animal models are needed to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders to enable, in turn, the development of novel therapies and genetic rescue strategies for the treatment of human disease.

%X Incompletely synthesized polypeptides in the mitochondrial inner membrane are subject to rapid proteolysis. We demonstrate that Yta10p, a mitochondrial homologue of a conserved family of putative ATPases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is essential for this proteolytic process. Yta10p-dependent degradation requires divalent metal ions and the hydrolysis of ATP. Yta10p is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane exposing the carboxy terminus to the mitochondrial matrix space. Based on the presence of consensus binding sites for ATP, and for divalent metal ions found in a number of metal dependent endopeptidases, a direct role of Yta10p in the proteolytic breakdown of membrane-associated polypeptides in mitochondria is suggested.

High levels of this transcriptional activator were found in muscle fibers with mtDNA accumulation in two patients with single mtDNA deletions. This is the first example of a nuclear gene product that varies with the levels of mtDNA in humans. Since transcription is required for the replication of mtDNA, it is possible that mtTFA may be involved in the regulation of mtDNA replication.

%X We have investigated nine children with infantile onset of mitochondrial myopathy and two adults with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERRF) and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), respectively. These patients lacked any of the previously known pathogenic tRNA mutations. Southern blot analysis of muscle mtDNA revealed no deletions. The tRNA genes of muscle mtDNA were sequenced. Restriction enzyme analysis of PCR fragments was performed to verify the presence of the mutations identified by automatic sequencing. Several tRNA mutations were found, but they were all homoplasmic. Furthermore, the mutations were either present in controls or did not change nucleotides conserved between species. This strongly suggests that none of the tRNA mutations identified in the 11 patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy was pathogenic. It can thus be concluded that mitochondrial tRNA mutations and mtDNA deletions probably are an infrequent cause of mitochondrial disorders in infants. Patients with MERRF and CPEO may lack both pathogenic point mutations of tRNA genes and deletions of mtDNA.

%X The folding of proteins and the assembly of protein complexes within subcompartments of the eukaryotic cell is catalysed by different members of the Hsp70 protein family. The chaperone function of Hsp70 proteins in these events is regulated by members of the DnaJ-like protein family, which occurs through direct interaction of different Hsp70 and DnaJ-like protein pairs that appear to be specifically adapted to each other. This review highlights the diversity of functions of DnaJ-like proteins by using specific examples of DnaJ-Hsp70 interactions with polypeptides in yeast protein-biogenesis pathways.

%X Molecular chaperones are a class of proteins that interact with the non-native conformations of other proteins. The major role of chaperones of the Hsp70 and Hsp60 families is to prevent aggregation of newly synthesized polypeptides and then to mediate their folding to the native state. As a result of functional studies of these proteins, there has been a revision of the long-held view that protein folding in the cell is a spontaneous process.

%X The reaction mechanism of protein folding by the chaperonin GroEL and its regulator GroES has been defined. GroES and substrate protein counteract each other's effects on GroEL: whereas GroES stabilizes GroEL in the ADP-bound state, binding of unfolded polypeptide within the cavity of the GroEL cylinder triggers ADP and GroES release. Upon ADP-ATP exchange, GroES reassociates with GroEL and ATP hydrolysis discharges the bound protein for folding. Partially folded protein rebinds to the chaperonin, thus perpetuating the cycle until folding is complete.

%X Members of the conserved Hsp70 chaperone family are assumed to constitute a main cellular system for the prevention and the amelioration of stress-induced protein damage, though little direct evidence exists for this function. We investigated the roles of the DnaK (Hsp70), DnaJ and GrpE chaperones of Escherichia coli in prevention and repair of thermally induced protein damage using firefly luciferase as a test substrate. In vivo, luciferase was rapidly inactivated at 42 degrees C, but was efficiently reactivated to 50% of its initial activity during subsequent incubation at 30 degrees C. DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE did not prevent luciferase inactivation, but were essential for its reactivation. In vitro, reactivation of heat-inactivated luciferase to 80% of its initial activity required the combined activity of DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE as well as ATP, but not GroEL and GroES. DnaJ associated with denatured luciferase, targeted DnaK to the substrate and co-operated with DnaK to prevent luciferase aggregation at 42 degrees C, an activity that was required for subsequent reactivation. The protein repair function of DnaK, GrpE and, in particular, DnaJ is likely to be part of the role of these proteins in regulation of the heat shock response.

%X Recent evidence supports the view that cellular protein folding may be mediated by molecular chaperones. A fundamental question concerns the stage in its biogenesis at which the folding protein makes first contact with these components. We show here by crosslinking that the chaperone DnaJ binds nascent ribosome-bound polypeptide chains as short as 55 residues. Cotranslational binding of DnaJ to firefly luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase resulted in an arrest of folding as long as the functional partners of DnaJ in Escherichia coli, DnaK and GrpE, were missing. Protein uptake into microsomes and mitochondria was also interrupted by DnaJ. Both folding and post-translational translocation recommenced upon addition of DnaK and GrpE. We propose that DnaJ protects nascent polypeptide chains against aggregation and, in cooperation with Hsp70, controls their productive folding once a complete polypeptide or a polypeptide domain has been synthesized.

%X The role of mitochondrial 70-kD heat shock protein (mt-hsp70) in protein translocation across both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes was studied using two temperature-sensitive yeast mutants. The degree of polypeptide translocation into the matrix of mutant mitochondria was analyzed using a matrix-targeted preprotein that was cleaved twice by the processing peptidase. A short amino-terminal segment of the preprotein (40-60 amino acids) was driven into the matrix by the membrane potential, independent of hsp70 function, allowing a single cleavage of the presequence. Artificial unfolding of the preprotein allowed complete translocation into the matrix in the case where mutant mt-hsp70 had detectable binding activity. However, in the mutant mitochondria in which binding to mt-hsp70 could not be detected the mature part of the preprotein was only translocated to the intermembrane space. We propose that mt-hsp70 fulfills a dual role in membrane translocation of preproteins. (a) Mt-hsp70 facilitates unfolding of the polypeptide chain for translocation across the mitochondrial membranes. (b) Binding of mt-hsp70 to the polypeptide chain is essential for driving the completion of transport of a matrix-targeted preprotein across the inner membrane. This second role is independent of the folding state of the preprotein, thus identifying mt-hsp70 as a genuine component of the inner membrane translocation machinery. Furthermore we determined the sites of the mutations and show that both a functional ATPase domain and ATP are needed for mt-hsp70 to bind to the polypeptide chain and drive its translocation into the matrix.

%X Skeletal muscle specimens from three patients with inclusion body myositis, aged 39, 60 and 71 years, respectively, were investigated. Enzyme histochemical staining of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), succinate dehydrogenase and myofibrillar ATPase, and in situ hybridization of transcripts of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were performed on consecutive sections. In all three cases a proportion of muscle fibres (2-5%) showed low or absent COX activity in spite of medium or high succinate dehydrogenase activity (COX deficient muscle fibres). Two probes detecting transcripts of different segments of mtDNA were used for the in situ hybridization. One of the probes (ND4 probe) detected transcripts of a segment of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene, which is known to be affected in most cases of mitochondrial myopathy with large deletions of mtDNA. There was reduced hybridization of the ND4 probe in many COX deficient muscle fibres compared with adjacent normal fibres. The other probe (ND2 probe) detected transcripts of a segment of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene, which usually is not included in mtDNA deletions. There was accumulation of transcripts corresponding to the ND2 probe in COX deficient fibres in all three cases. These findings demonstrate that deleted mtDNA had accumulated in COX deficient muscle fibres in patients with inclusion body myositis. Southern blot analysis of mtDNA in muscle revealed a 16.6 kb fragment corresponding to normal mtDNA in all three cases. In one case two additional less abundant fragments of smaller size, corresponding to deleted mtDNA, were detected. Ultrastructural investigation showed abnormal mitochondria in all three cases. Control muscle specimens were obtained from nine patients, aged 63-71 years, with muscle pain but without morphological evidence of muscle disease. Occasional COX deficient fibres (< 1%) were found in three of the control cases. The other six control cases showed no COX deficient fibres. Our results show that mtDNA deletions may be involved in the pathogenesis of inclusion body myositis and cause respiratory chain dysfunction in muscle fibre segments.

%X We have investigated the morphology, cytogenetics, and the fraction of mtDNA with the tRNA(Lys) A-->G(8344) mutation in three lipomas in a carrier of this mutation. The son of the patient had myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers syndrome. The fraction of mtDNA with the tRNA(Lys) mutation varied between 62% and 80% in cultured skin fibroblasts, lymphocytes, normal adipose tissue, and muscle. In the three lipomas the mean fraction of mutated mtDNA was 90%, 94%, and 94%. Ultrastructural examination of the lipomas revealed numerous mitochondria with changes such as electron-dense inclusions in some adipocytes. When considered cytogenetically, the lipomas were characterized by a mixture of karyotypically abnormal and normal cells. An identical del(6)(q24) was found in two tumors. The fraction of mutated mtDNA in cultured lipoma cells was the same as in the lipoma in situ, indicating that the cultured cells were representative of the primary tumor. These findings indicate that the lipomas have originated with a grossly normal stem line and subsequently have developed the 6q deletion. We conclude that the lipomas represent clonal growth of adipocytes with a high content of mtDNA with the tRNA(Lys) mutation. The tRNA(Lys) mutation may be either the direct or the indirect cause of pertubation of the maturation process of the adipocytes, leading to an increased risk of lipoma formation.

%X We have studied the segregation and manifestations of the tRNA(Lys) A-->G(8344) mutation of mtDNA. Three unrelated patients with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERRF) syndrome were investigated, along with 30 of their maternal relatives. Mutated mtDNA was not always found in the offspring of women carrying the tRNA(Lys) mutation. Four women had 10%-33% of mutated mtDNA in lymphocytes, and no mutated mtDNA was found in 7 of their 14 investigated children. The presence of mutated mtDNA was excluded at a level of 3:1,000. Five women had a proportion of 43%-73% mutated mtDNA in lymphocytes, and mutated mtDNA was found in all their 12 investigated children. This suggests that the risk for transmission of mutated mtDNA to the offspring increases if high levels are present in the mother and that, above a threshold level of 35%-40%, it is very likely that transmission will occur to all children. The three patients with MERRF syndrome had, in muscle, both 94%-96% mutated mtDNA and biochemical and histochemical evidence of a respiratory-chain dysfunction. Four relatives had a proportion of 61%-92% mutated mtDNA in muscle, and biochemical measurements showed a normal respiratory-chain function in muscle in all cases. These findings suggest that > 92% of mtDNA with the tRNA(Lys) mutation in muscle is required to cause a respiratory-chain dysfunction that can be detected by biochemical methods. There was a positive correlation between the levels of mtDNA with the tRNA(Lys) mutation in lymphocytes and the levels in muscle, in all nine investigated cases. The levels of mutated mtDNA were higher in muscle than in lymphocytes in all cases. In two of the patients with MERRF syndrome, muscle specimens were obtained at different times. In both cases, biochemical measurements revealed a deteriorating respiratory-chain function, and in one case a progressive increase in the amount of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient muscle fibers was found.

%X The mechanism of GroEL (chaperonin)-mediated protein folding is only partially understood. We have analysed structural and functional properties of the interaction between GroEL and the co-chaperonin GroES. The stoichiometry of the GroEL 14mer and the GroES 7mer in the functional holo-chaperonin is 1:1. GroES protects half of the GroEL subunits from proteolytic truncation of the approximately 50 C-terminal residues. Removal of this region results in an inhibition of the GroEL ATPase, mimicking the effect of GroES on full-length GroEL. Image analysis of electron micrographs revealed that GroES binding triggers conspicuous conformational changes both in the GroES adjacent end and at the opposite end of the GroEL cylinder. This apparently prohibits the association of a second GroES oligomer. Addition of denatured polypeptide leads to the appearance of irregularly shaped, stain-excluding masses within the GroEL double-ring, which are larger with bound alcohol oxidase (75 kDa) than with rhodanese (35 kDa). We conclude that the functional complex of GroEL and GroES is characterized by asymmetrical binding of GroES to one end of the GroEL cylinder and suggest that binding of the substrate protein occurs within the central cavity of GroEL.

%X We report the finding of mitochondrial ATP-synthase deficiency in a child with persistent 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. The child presented in the neonatal period with severe lactic acidosis, which was controlled by Na-HCO3 and glucose infusions. During the 1st y of life, there were several episodes of lactic acidosis precipitated by infections or prolonged intervals between meals. The excretion of lactate in urine was variable, but there was a persistent high excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid. The activity of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase in fibroblasts was normal. The child had a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and magnetic resonance images revealed hypoplasia of corpus callosum. The gross motor and mental development was retarded, but there were no other neurologic signs. Investigation of muscle mitochondrial function at 1 y of age revealed a severe mitochondrial ATP-synthase deficiency (oligomycin-sensitive, dinitrophenol-stimulated Mg2+ ATPase activity: 27 nmol x min-1 x (mg protein)-1, control range 223-673 nmol x min-1 x (mg protein)-1. The mitochondrial respiratory rate was low and tightly coupled. The respiratory rate was normalized by the addition of an uncoupler. Low Mg2+ ATPase activity was also demonstrated by histochemical methods. Morphologic examination revealed ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondria. There was no deletion of mitochondrial DNA. The sequences of the ATP synthase subunit genes of mitochondrial DNA were in accordance with published normal sequences.

%X We have sequenced the breakpoints of deleted mtDNA in muscle from four children with mitochondrial myopathy and multisystem mitochondrial disorders. The deletions were 4884, 6067, 7663 and 7150 base pairs (bp) in size and affected several protein and transfer RNA genes. The sequences needed for transcription and replication of mtDNA were not affected in any case. The deletions were flanked by direct short repeats in all cases. Multiple repeats were found in case 1 and 4. Imperfect repeats were found in case 3 and 4 and this made it possible to distinguish the repeats 5' and 3' to the deletion. In both cases the 3' repeat was retained. The deletion of 7663 bp in case 3 has been reported in two other cases and may represent a second hotspot for mtDNA deletions in addition to the common deletion of 4977 bp found in one third of cases. A comparison of the breakpoint sequence of case 3 with the two other reported cases revealed that when a deletion is formed between the same repeats in different patients either the 5' or 3' repeat can be retained. This study shows that both single and multiple repeats can be associated with single mtDNA deletions and that both 5' and 3' repeated sequences can be retained. These findings are consistent with the slip-replication model for the generation of mtDNA deletions.

%X We have studied cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficient muscle fibre segments in 6 patients with mitochondrial myopathy and deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The distribution of transcripts of normal and mutated mtDNA in skeletal muscle sections was studied by in situ hybridization. The results were compared with the enzyme histochemical activity of COX and the immunohistochemical distribution of mtDNA encoded and nuclear DNA encoded subunits of COX. In all cases a proportion of the muscle fibres (less than 1-30% of the fibres in cross-sections) had low COX activity and high activity of succinate dehydrogenase (COX deficient muscle fibres). Transcripts of normal and deleted mtDNA showed the same distribution within the tissue as the corresponding mtDNA, indicating that the deleted mtDNA is transcribed. The COX deficient muscle fibres showed accumulation of transcripts of deleted mtDNA, which had a similar distribution as the accumulated mitochondria within these fibres. With few exceptions, there was a low level of transcripts of normal mtDNA in these COX deficient fibres. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed low levels of immunoreactive material using antiserum to the mtDNA encoded subunits II/III as well as the nuclear DNA encoded subunit IV of COX in all COX deficient muscle fibres. The fraction of deleted mtDNA in muscle ranged from 43 to 87%. There was no correlation between the proportion of COX deficient muscle fibres and the fraction of deleted mtDNA. In 2 cases the deletion did not involve any COX gene. One of these cases had 87% deleted mtDNA but less than 1% COX deficient muscle fibres.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

%X We have studied the use of yeast peroxisomal alcohol oxidase (AO) as a model protein for in vitro binding by GroEL. Dilution of denatured AO in neutral buffer leads to aggregation of the protein, which is prevented by the addition of GroEL. Formation of complexes between GroEL and denatured AO was demonstrated by a gel-shift assay using non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and quantified by laser-densitometry of the gels. In the presence of MgAMP-PNP or MgADP the affinity of GroEL for AO was enhanced. Under these conditions up to 70% of the purified GroEL formed a complex with this protein. Release was stimulated at room temperature by MgATP, and was further enhanced by addition of GroES.

%X PMR1, a Ca(2+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) homologue in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae localizes to a novel Golgi-like organelle. Consistent with a Golgi localization, the bulk of PMR1 comigrates with Golgi markers in subcellular fractionation experiments, and staining of PMR1 by indirect immunofluorescence reveals a punctate pattern resembling Golgi staining in yeast. However, PMR1 shows only partial colocalization with known Golgi markers, KEX2 and SEC7, in double-label immunofluorescence experiments. The effect of PMR1 on Golgi function is indicated by pleiotropic defects in various Golgi processes in pmr1 mutants, including impaired proteolytic processing of pro-alpha factor and incomplete outer chain glycosylation of invertase. Consistent with the proposed role of PMR1 as a Ca2+ pump, these defects are reversed by the addition of millimolar levels of extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that Ca2+ disposition is essential to normal Golgi function. Absence of PMR1 function partially suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defects of several sec mutants, and overexpression of PMR1 restricts the growth of others. Some of these interactions are modulated by changes in external Ca2+ concentrations. These results imply a global role for Ca2+ in the proper function of components governing transit and processing through the secretory pathway.

%X The main stress proteins of Escherichia coli function in an ordered protein-folding reaction. DnaK (heat-shock protein 70) recognizes the folding polypeptide as an extended chain and cooperates with DnaJ in stabilizing an intermediate conformational state lacking ordered tertiary structure. Dependent on GrpE and ATP hydrolysis, the protein is then transferred to GroEL (heat-shock protein 60) which acts catalytically in the production of the native state. This sequential mechanism of chaperone action may represent an important pathway for the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides.

%X We have investigated the daughter of a woman with Kearns-Sayre syndrome. The woman had a high percentage of deleted mtDNA in muscle, but no deleted mtDNA was detected in fibroblasts, bone marrow, and peripheral blood cells by Southern blot analysis. With PCR, analytical sensitivity was significantly increased, and deleted mtDNA was detected in all examined tissues from this patient. The patient had healthy parents and nine healthy siblings. No deleted mtDNA was detected in blood from the mother of the patient. The patient had an uneventful pregnancy and delivered at term. Deleted mtDNA could not be detected in placenta by Southern blot analysis. With PCR, deleted mtDNA was detected in the majority of placental specimens. This finding may, however, be due to contamination with maternal DNA. The patient's daughter was healthy at age 5 mo, and morphologic examination of muscle was normal. No transmission of deleted mtDNA to the daughter could be detected by Southern blot and PCR analysis of peripheral blood cells, bone marrow, fibroblasts, and muscle. The presence of deleted mtDNA was excluded at a fractional level of less than 1:100,000 in all examined tissues from the daughter.

%X We investigated a family with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy in which affected individuals were homoplasmic for the point mutation of the NADH-dehydrogenase 4 gene of mitochondrial DNA, described by Wallace and colleagues in 1988. The proband had bilateral optic atrophy, tremor, dystonia, and sharply defined lesions in the putamen on magnetic resonance images. Optic atrophy was found in another 3 of 13 investigated relatives on the maternal side. Additional neurological signs were found but only in patients with optic neuropathy. The morphological appearance and the respiratory chain function of muscle tissue were investigated in the proband, his mother, and 3 siblings. Polarographic measurements revealed complex I deficiency in the 5 investigated subjects. Morphological changes of mitochondria were found in 4 of these subjects. There was no decrease in complex I activity measured as NADH ferricyanide reductase or rotenone-sensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase activities. In other cases with complex I deficiency, good agreement between polarographic and spectrophotometric measurements was found. This study showed that there is decreased activity of complex I of the respiratory chain in muscle and that cerebral striatal lesions occur in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy with the NADH-dehydrogenase 4 gene point mutation.

%X Folding of two monomeric enzymes mediated by groE has been reconstituted in vitro. The groEL protein stabilizes the polypeptides in a conformation resembling the 'molten globule' state. Mg-ATP and groES then promote the acquisition of ordered tertiary structure at the surface of groEL. Folding requires the hydrolysis of about 100 ATP molecules per protein monomer. This active process of surface-mediated chain folding might represent a general mechanism for the formation of protein structure in vivo.

%X We have performed morphologic and biochemical studies in three pediatric cases of Kearns-Sayre syndrome. All cases had heteroplasmy with a high percentage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with deletion in muscle. The deletions were mapped to the same region of mtDNA but were of different sizes. The same type of deletion could also be detected in fibroblasts from all cases but the percentage was considerably lower. In two cases, an increase with time of the mutated mtDNA fraction in muscle was found and this increase paralleled the progression of the disease. Oximetric evaluation of respiratory-chain function in isolated muscle mitochondria showed a complex I deficiency in one case and was normal in the two other cases. Comparison of the fractional concentration of mtDNA with deletion in muscle and isolated mitochondria showed that the isolated mitochondria were not representative of the mitochondrial population in muscle. Mitochondria with high percentage of mtDNA with deletion were selectively lost. The finding of different mitochondrial populations is in good agreement with the morphology. One case spontaneously recovered from an infantile sideroblastic anemia before the development of Kearns-Sayre syndrome. The anemia was of the same type as that in Pearson's syndrome, a mitochondrial disorder with high amounts of mtDNA with deletion in blood cells. These findings indicate that the phenotype of a mtDNA deletion disorder can change with time and is governed by the fractional concentration of mtDNA with deletion in different tissues.

%X D-Lactate dehydrogenase from the extreme halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium marismortui has been partially purified by ammonium-sulfate fractionation, hydrophobic and ion exchange chromatography. Catalytic activity of the enzyme requires salt concentrations beyond 1M NaCl: optimum conditions are 4M NaCl or KCl, pH 6-8, 50 degrees C. Michaelis constants for NADH and pyruvate under optimum conditions of enzymatic activity are 0.070 and 4.5mM, respectively. As for other bacterial D-specific lactate dehydrogenases, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+) do not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. As shown by gel-filtration and ultracentrifugal analysis, the enzyme under the conditions of the enzyme assay is a dimer with a subunit molecular mass close to 36 kDa. At low salt concentrations (less than 1M), as well as high concentrations of chaotropic solvent components and low pH, the enzyme undergoes reversible deactivation, dissociation and denaturation. The temperature dependence of the enzymatic activity shows non-linear Arrhenius behavior with activation energies of the order of 90 and 25 kJ/mol at temperatures below and beyond ca. 30 degrees C. In the presence of high salt, the enzyme exhibits exceptional thermal stability; denaturation only occurs at temperatures beyond 55 degrees C. The half-time of deactivation at 70 and 75 degrees C is 300 and 15 min, respectively. Maximum stability is observed at pH 7.5-9.0.

%X The neuropathological changes found at autopsy in a case of Kearns-Sayre syndrome are described. We have previously analyzed the respiratory chain function in isolated muscle mitochondria and also described a large deletion of muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in this case. The neuropathological examination revealed prominent neuronal degeneration and gliosis of the basal ganglia and there were bilateral areas of softening and total loss of nerve cells in the lenticular nuclei. The pallidum and caudate nucleus disclosed accumulation of iron-containing pigment. The white matter in the cerebrum, brain stem and cerebellum showed widespread and focally accentuated spongy change due to splitting of myelin lamellae. It is suggested that deficiency of respiratory chain enzymes due to the mtDNA deletion is of pathogenetic importance in the development of the described changes.

%X The genes for two new P-type ATPases, PMR1 and PMR2, have been identified in yeast. A comparison of the deduced sequences of the PMR proteins with other known ion pumps showed that both proteins are very similar to Ca2+ ATPases. PMR1 is identical to SSC1, a gene previously identified by its effect on secretion of some foreign proteins from yeast. Proteins secreted from pmr1 mutants lack the outer chain glycosylation that normally results from passage through the Golgi. Loss of PMR1 function suppresses the lethality of ypt1-1, a mutation that blocks the secretion pathway. These data suggest that PMR1 functions as a Ca2+ pump affecting transit through the secretory pathway.

%X Tetrakis(4-7V-methylpyridyl)porphine (H2TMpyP) and a number of its metal derivatives interact extensively with mononucleotides and mononucleosides in aqueous solution. The complexes formed are of a stacking-type involving extensive overlap of the -systems of the porphyrin and purine or pyrimidine bases. Coulombic attractions help stabilize the complexes but there is no evidence for ligation of the bases to axial sites of the metalloporphyrins. Stability constants determined via NMR and spectrophotometric titrations are larger for purine bases than pyrimidines with a given porphyrin derivative. More dramatic influences on stability result from changing porphyrins. Porphyrins having no axial ligands (e.g., metal-free copper(II), palladium(II), and nickel(II) derivatives) or one axial ligand (Zn(II)) produce much larger interactions with a given nucleotide or nucleoside than do metalloporphyrins having two axial ligands (e.g., Mn(III), Fe(III), or Co(III)). The kinetics of the interaction of H2TMpyP with 2'-deoxyadenosine S'-monophosphate (dAMP) were studied via the laser raman temperature-jump method. The measured rate constants are consistent with a simple stacking model for the interaction.

%X We have previously identified transcription factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) as a type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk gene, using human and mouse genetics. To further understand the function of TFB1M and how it is associated with T2D, we created a beta-cell-specific knockout of Tfb1m, which gradually developed diabetes. Prior to the onset of diabetes, beta-Tfb1m(-/-) mice exhibited retarded glucose clearance owing to impaired insulin secretion. beta-Tfb1m(-/-) islets released less insulin in response to fuels, contained less insulin and secretory granules and displayed reduced beta-cell mass. Moreover, mitochondria in Tfb1m-deficient beta-cells were more abundant with disrupted architecture. TFB1M is known to control mitochondrial protein translation by adenine dimethylation of 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Here, we found that the levels of TFB1M and mitochondrial-encoded proteins, mitochondrial 12S rRNA methylation, ATP production and oxygen consumption were reduced in beta-Tfb1m(-/-) islets. Furthermore, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to cellular stress were increased whereas induction of defense mechanisms was attenuated. We also show increased apoptosis and necrosis as well as infiltration of macrophages and CD4(+) cells in the islets. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Tfb1m-deficiency in beta-cells caused mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequently diabetes owing to combined loss of beta-cell function and mass. These observations reflect pathogenetic processes in human islets: using RNA sequencing, we found that the TFB1M risk variant exhibited a negative gene-dosage effect on islet TFB1M mRNA levels, as well as insulin secretion. Our findings highlight the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in impairments of beta-cell function and mass, the hallmarks of T2D.

%X Although the gonad primarily functions in procreation, it also affects animal life span. Here, we show that removal of the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line triggers a switch in the regulatory state of the organism to promote longevity, co-opting components involved in larval developmental timing circuits. These components include the DAF-12 steroid receptor, which is involved in the larval stage two-to-stage three (L2-L3) transition and up-regulates members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family. The miRNAs target an early larval nuclear factor lin-14 and akt-1/kinase, thereby stimulating DAF-16/FOXO signaling to extend life. Our studies suggest that metazoan life span is coupled to the gonad through elements of a developmental timer.

%X Transcription factor A (TFAM) functions as a DNA packaging factor in mammalian mitochondria. TFAM also binds sequence-specifically to sites immediately upstream of mitochondrial promoters, but there are conflicting data regarding its role as a core component of the mitochondrial transcription machinery. We here demonstrate that TFAM is required for transcription in mitochondrial extracts as well as in a reconstituted in vitro transcription system. The absolute requirement of TFAM can be relaxed by conditions that allow DNA breathing, i.e., low salt concentrations or negatively supercoiled DNA templates. The situation is thus very similar to that described in nuclear RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, in which the free energy of supercoiling can circumvent the need for a subset of basal transcription factors at specific promoters. In agreement with these observations, we demonstrate that TFAM has the capacity to induce negative supercoils in DNA, and, using the recently developed nucleobase analog FRET-pair tC(O)-tC(nitro), we find that TFAM distorts significantly the DNA structure. Our findings differ from recent observations reporting that TFAM is not a core component of the mitochondrial transcription machinery. Instead, our findings support a model in which TFAM is absolutely required to recruit the transcription machinery during initiation of transcription.

%X Intracellular receptor DAF-12 regulates dauer formation and developmental age and affects Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan. Genetic analyses place DAF-12 at the convergence of several signal transduction pathways; however, the downstream effectors and the molecular basis for the receptor's multiple physiological outputs are unknown. Beginning with C. elegans genomic DNA, we devised a procedure for multiple rounds of selection and amplification that yielded fragments bearing DAF-12-binding sites. These genomic fragments mediated DAF-12-dependent transcriptional regulation both in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in C. elegans; that is, they served as functional DAF-12 response elements. We determined that most of the genomic fragments that displayed DAF-12 response element activity in yeast were linked to genes that were regulated by DAF-12 in C. elegans; indeed, the response element-containing fragments typically resided within clusters of DAF-12-regulated genes. DAF-12 target gene regulation was developmental program and stage specific, potentially predicting a fit of these targets into regulatory networks governing aspects of C. elegans reproductive development and dauer formation.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important contributor to human pathology and it is estimated that mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause approximately 0.5-1% of all types of diabetes mellitus. We have generated a mouse model for mitochondrial diabetes by tissue-specific disruption of the nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam, previously mtTFA; ref. 7) in pancreatic beta-cells. This transcriptional activator is imported to mitochondria, where it is essential for mtDNA expression and maintenance. The Tfam-mutant mice developed diabetes from the age of approximately 5 weeks and displayed severe mtDNA depletion, deficient oxidative phosphorylation and abnormal appearing mitochondria in islets at the ages of 7-9 weeks. We performed physiological studies of beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling in islets isolated from 7-9-week-old mutant mice and found reduced hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, impaired Ca(2+)-signalling and lowered insulin release in response to glucose stimulation. We observed reduced beta-cell mass in older mutants. Our findings identify two phases in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diabetes; mutant beta-cells initially display reduced stimulus-secretion coupling, later followed by beta-cell loss. This animal model reproduces the beta-cell pathology of human mitochondrial diabetes and provides genetic evidence for a critical role of the respiratory chain in insulin secretion.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction due to impaired respiratory chain function is increasingly recognized as an important cause of human disease. Mitochondrial disorders are relatively common and have an estimated incidence of 1:10,000 live births. There are more than 100 different point mutations and numerous large rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; mainly single deletions) that cause human disease. We aimed at obtaining an animal model to study physiological aspects of mtDNA mutation disorders. There are as yet unsolved technical problems associated with transfection of mammalian mitochondria. We therefore choose to manipulate mtDNA expression by targeting of the nuclear gene encoding Tfam. We utilised the cre-loxP recombination system to disrupt Tfam since this system allows manipulation of respiratory chain function in selected mouse tissues. We have found increased cell death or apoptosis induction in both germ line and tissue-specific Tfam knockouts. Our results further suggest that increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is not a prominent feature in cells with impaired mtDNA expression.

%X We have created P1 artificial chromosome transgenic mice expressing the human mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and thus generated mice with a physiologically controlled augmentation of SOD2 expression leading to increased SOD2 enzyme activities and lowered superoxide levels. In the transgenic mice, effects on mitochondrial function such as enhanced oxidative capacity and greater resistance against inducers of mitochondrial permeability were observed. Superoxide in the mitochondrial matrix has been proposed to activate uncoupling proteins (UCPs), thus providing a feedback mechanism that will lower respiratory chain superoxide production by increasing a proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, UCP1 and UCP3 activities and mitochondrial ATP production rates were not altered in isolated mitochondria from SOD2 transgenic mice, despite lowered superoxide levels. Globally, the transgenic mice displayed normal resting metabolic rates, indicating an absence of effect on any UCP activities, and normal oxygen consumption responses after norepinephrine injection. These results strongly suggest that endogenously generated matrix superoxide does not regulate UCP activity and in vivo energy expenditure.

%X Mitochondria are bioenergetic hotspots, producing the bulk of ATP by the oxidative phosphorylation process. Mitochondria are also structurally dynamic and undergo coordinated fusion and fission to maintain their function. Recent studies of the mitochondrial fusion machinery have provided new evidence in detailing their role in mitochondrial metabolism. Remarkably, mitofusin 2, in addition to its role in fusion, is important for maintaining coenzyme Q levels and may be an integral player in the mevalonate synthesis pathway. Here, we review the bioenergetic roles of mitochondrial dynamics and emphasize the importance of the in vitro growth conditions when evaluating mitochondrial respiration.

%X Discovery of trans-splicing in multiple metazoan lineages led to the identification of operon-like gene organization in diverse organisms, including trypanosomes, tunicates, and nematodes, but the functional significance of such operons is not completely understood. To see whether the content or organization of operons serves similar roles across species, we experimentally defined operons in the nematode model Pristionchus pacificus. We performed affinity capture experiments on mRNA pools to specifically enrich for transcripts that are trans-spliced to either the SL1- or SL2-spliced leader, using spliced leader-specific probes. We obtained distinct trans-splicing patterns from the analysis of three mRNA pools (total mRNA, SL1 and SL2 fraction) by RNA-seq. This information was combined with a genome-wide analysis of gene orientation and spacing. We could confirm 2219 operons by RNA-seq data out of 6709 candidate operons, which were predicted by sequence information alone. Our gene order comparison of the Caenorhabditis elegans and P. pacificus genomes shows major changes in operon organization in the two species. Notably, only 128 out of 1288 operons in C. elegans are conserved in P. pacificus. However, analysis of gene-expression profiles identified conserved functions such as an enrichment of germline-expressed genes and higher expression levels of operonic genes during recovery from dauer arrest in both species. These results provide support for the model that a necessity for increased transcriptional efficiency in the context of certain developmental processes could be a selective constraint for operon evolution in metazoans. Our method is generally applicable to other metazoans to see if similar functional constraints regulate gene organization into operons.

%X Summary Identifying the molecular mechanisms that underlie aging and their pharmacological manipulation are key aims for improving lifelong human health. Here, we identify a critical role for Ras-Erk-ETS signaling in aging in Drosophila. We show that inhibition of Ras is sufficient for lifespan extension downstream of reduced insulin/IGF-1 (IIS) signaling. Moreover, direct reduction of Ras or Erk activity leads to increased lifespan. We identify the E-twenty six (ETS) transcriptional repressor, Anterior open (Aop), as central to lifespan extension caused by reduced IIS or Ras attenuation. Importantly, we demonstrate that adult-onset administration of the drug trametinib, a highly specific inhibitor of Ras-Erk-ETS signaling, can extend lifespan. This discovery of the Ras-Erk-ETS pathway as a pharmacological target for animal aging, together with the high degree of evolutionary conservation of the pathway, suggests that inhibition of Ras-Erk-ETS signaling may provide an effective target for anti-aging interventions in mammals.

%X The biguanide drug, metformin, commonly used to treat type-2 diabetes, has been shown to extend lifespan and reduce fecundity in C. elegans through a dietary restriction-like mechanism via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the AMPK-activating kinase, LKB1. We have investigated whether the longevity-promoting effects of metformin are evolutionarily conserved using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We show here that while feeding metformin to adult Drosophila resulted in a robust activation of AMPK and reduced lipid stores, it did not increase lifespan in either male or female flies. In fact, we found that when administered at high concentrations, metformin is toxic to flies. Furthermore, no decreases in female fecundity were observed except at the most toxic dose. Analysis of intestinal physiology after metformin treatment suggests that these deleterious effects may result from disruptions to intestinal fluid homeostasis. Thus, metformin appears to have evolutionarily conserved effects on metabolism but not on fecundity or lifespan.

%X The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-like signaling (IIS) pathway in metazoans has evolutionarily conserved roles in growth control, metabolic homeostasis, stress responses, reproduction, and lifespan. Genetic manipulations that reduce IIS in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the mouse have been shown not only to produce substantial increases in lifespan but also to ameliorate several age-related diseases. In C. elegans, the multitude of phenotypes produced by the reduction in IIS are all suppressed in the absence of the worm FOXO transcription factor, DAF-16, suggesting that they are all under common regulation. It is not yet clear in other animal models whether the activity of FOXOs mediate all of the physiological effects of reduced IIS, especially increased lifespan. We have addressed this issue by examining the effects of reduced IIS in the absence of dFOXO in Drosophila, using a newly generated null allele of dfoxo. We found that the removal of dFOXO almost completely blocks IIS-dependent lifespan extension. However, unlike in C. elegans, removal of dFOXO does not suppress the body size, fecundity, or oxidative stress resistance phenotypes of IIS-compromised flies. In contrast, IIS-dependent xenobiotic resistance is fully dependent on dFOXO activity. Our results therefore suggest that there is evolutionary divergence in the downstream mechanisms that mediate the effects of IIS. They also imply that in Drosophila, additional factors act alongside dFOXO to produce IIS-dependent responses in body size, fecundity, and oxidative stress resistance and that these phenotypes are not causal in IIS-mediated extension of lifespan.

%X Drosophila Lnk is the single ancestral orthologue of a highly conserved family of structurally-related intracellular adaptor proteins, the SH2B proteins. As adaptors, they lack catalytic activity but contain several protein-protein interaction domains, thus playing a critical role in signal transduction from receptor tyrosine kinases to form protein networks. Physiological studies of SH2B function in mammals have produced conflicting data. However, a recent study in Drosophila has shown that Lnk is an important regulator of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling (IIS) pathway during growth, functioning in parallel to the insulin receptor substrate, Chico. As this pathway also has an evolutionary conserved role in the determination of organism lifespan, we investigated whether Lnk is required for normal lifespan in Drosophila. Phenotypic analysis of mutants for Lnk revealed that loss of Lnk function results in increased lifespan and improved survival under conditions of oxidative stress and starvation. Starvation resistance was found to be associated with increased metabolic stores of carbohydrates and lipids indicative of impaired metabolism. Biochemical and genetic data suggest that Lnk functions in both the IIS and Ras/Mitogen activated protein Kinase (MapK) signaling pathways. Microarray studies support this model, showing transcriptional feedback onto genes in both pathways as well as indicating global changes in both lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Finally, our data also suggest that Lnk itself may be a direct target of the IIS responsive transcription factor, dFoxo, and that dFoxo may repress Lnk expression. We therefore describe novel functions for a member of the SH2B protein family and provide the first evidence for potential mechanisms of SH2B regulation. Our findings suggest that IIS signaling in Drosophila may require the activity of a second intracellular adaptor, thereby yielding fundamental new insights into the functioning and role of the IIS pathway in ageing and metabolism.

%X In metazoans, tissue growth relies on the availability of nutrients--stored internally or obtained from the environment--and the resulting activation of insulin/IGF signaling (IIS). In Drosophila, growth is mediated by seven Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps), acting through a canonical IIS pathway. During the larval period, animals feed and Dilps produced by the brain couple nutrient uptake with systemic growth. We show here that, during metamorphosis, when feeding stops, a specific DILP (Dilp6) is produced by the fat body and relays the growth signal. Expression of DILP6 during pupal development is controlled by the steroid hormone ecdysone. Remarkably, DILP6 expression is also induced upon starvation, and both its developmental and environmental expression require the Drosophila FoxO transcription factor. This study reveals a specific class of ILPs induced upon metabolic stress that promotes growth in conditions of nutritional deprivation or following developmentally induced cessation of feeding.

%X Abeta peptide accumulation is thought to be the primary event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with downstream neurotoxic effects including the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is increasingly implicated as playing a pivotal role in this amyloid cascade. We have developed an adult-onset Drosophila model of AD, using an inducible gene expression system to express Arctic mutant Abeta42 specifically in adult neurons, to avoid developmental effects. Abeta42 accumulated with age in these flies and they displayed increased mortality together with progressive neuronal dysfunction, but in the apparent absence of neuronal loss. This fly model can thus be used to examine the role of events during adulthood and early AD aetiology. Expression of Abeta42 in adult neurons increased GSK-3 activity, and inhibition of GSK-3 (either genetically or pharmacologically by lithium treatment) rescued Abeta42 toxicity. Abeta42 pathogenesis was also reduced by removal of endogenous fly tau; but, within the limits of detection of available methods, tau phosphorylation did not appear to be altered in flies expressing Abeta42. The GSK-3-mediated effects on Abeta42 toxicity appear to be at least in part mediated by tau-independent mechanisms, because the protective effect of lithium alone was greater than that of the removal of tau alone. Finally, Abeta42 levels were reduced upon GSK-3 inhibition, pointing to a direct role of GSK-3 in the regulation of Abeta42 peptide level, in the absence of APP processing. Our study points to the need both to identify the mechanisms by which GSK-3 modulates Abeta42 levels in the fly and to determine if similar mechanisms are present in mammals, and it supports the potential therapeutic use of GSK-3 inhibitors in AD.

%X The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is age, and changes in the ageing nervous system are likely contributors to AD pathology. Amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, which occurs as a result of the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is thought to initiate the pathogenesis of AD, eventually leading to neuronal cell death. Previously, we developed an adult-onset Drosophila model of AD. Mutant Abeta42 accumulation led to increased mortality and neuronal dysfunction in the adult flies. Furthermore, we showed that lithium reduced Abeta42 protein, but not mRNA, and was able to rescue Abeta42-induced toxicity. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism/s by which lithium modulates Abeta42 protein levels and Abeta42 induced toxicity in the fly model. We found that lithium caused a reduction in protein synthesis in Drosophila and hence the level of Abeta42. At both the low and high doses tested, lithium rescued the locomotory defects induced by Abeta42, but it rescued lifespan only at lower doses, suggesting that long-term, high-dose lithium treatment may have induced toxicity. Lithium also down-regulated translation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe associated with increased chronological lifespan. Our data highlight a role for lithium and reduced protein synthesis as potential therapeutic targets for AD pathogenesis.

%X Several species of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) exist as a result of differential cleavage from amyloid precursor protein (APP) to yield various C-terminal Abeta peptides. Several N-terminal modified Abeta peptides have also been identified in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, the most common of which is pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (AbetapE3-42). AbetapE3-42 peptide has an increased propensity to aggregate, appears to accumulate in the brain before the appearance of clinical symptoms of AD, and precedes Abeta1-42 deposition. Moreover, in vitro studies have shown that AbetapE3-42 can act as a seed for full length Abeta1-42. In this study, we characterized the Drosophila model of AbetapE3-42 toxicity by expressing the peptide in specific sets of neurons using the GAL4-UAS system, and measuring different phenotypic outcomes. We found that AbetapE3-42 peptide had an increased propensity to aggregate. Expression of AbetapE3-42 in the neurons of adult flies led to behavioural dysfunction and shortened lifespan. Expression of AbetapE3-42 constitutively in the eyes led to disorganised ommatidia, and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. The eye disruption was almost completely rescued by co-expressing a candidate Abeta degrading enzyme, neprilysin2. Furthermore, we found that neprilysin2 was capable of degrading AbetapE3-42. Also, we tested the seeding hypothesis for AbetapE3-42 in vivo, and measured its effect on Abeta1-42 levels. We found that Abeta1-42 levels were significantly increased when Abeta1-42 and AbetapE3-42 peptides were co-expressed. Furthermore, we found that AbetapE3-42 enhanced Abeta1-42 toxicity in vivo. Our findings implicate AbetapE3-42 as an important source of toxicity in AD, and suggest that its specific degradation could be therapeutic.

%X We generated mitochondrial late-onset neurodegeneration (MILON) mice with postnatal disruption of oxidative phosphorylation in forebrain neurons. They develop normally and display no overt behavioral disturbances or histological changes during the first 5 months of life. The MILON mice display reduced levels of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial RNA from 2 and 4 months of age, respectively, and severely respiratory chain-deficient neurons from 4 months of age. Surprisingly, these respiratory chain-deficient neurons are viable for at least 1 month without showing signs of neurodegeneration or major induction of defenses against oxidative stress. Prolonged neuronal respiratory chain deficiency is thus required for the induction of neurodegeneration. Before developing neurological symptoms, MILON mice show increased vulnerability to excitotoxic stress. We observed a markedly enhanced sensitivity to excitotoxic challenge, manifest as an abundance of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) reactive cells after kainic acid injection, in 4-month-old MILON mice, showing that respiratory chain-deficient neurons are more vulnerable to stress. At approximately 5-5.5 months of age, MILON mice start to show signs of disease, followed by death shortly thereafter. The debut of overt disease in MILON mice coincides with onset of rapidly progressive neurodegeneration and massive cell death in hippocampus and neocortex. This profound neurodegenerative process is manifested as axonal degeneration, gliosis, and abundant TUNEL-positive nuclei. The MILON mouse model provides a novel and powerful tool for additional studies of the role for respiratory chain deficiency in neurodegeneration and aging.

%X Dietary restriction (DR), a moderate reduction in food intake, improves health during aging and extends life span across multiple species. Specific nutrients, rather than overall calories, mediate the effects of DR, with protein and specific amino acids (AAs) playing a key role. Modulations of single dietary AAs affect traits including growth, reproduction, physiology, health, and longevity in animals. Epidemiological data in humans also link the quality and quantity of dietary proteins to long-term health. Intricate nutrient-sensing pathways fine tune the metabolic responses to dietary AAs in a highly conserved manner. In turn, these metabolic responses can affect the onset of insulin resistance, obesity, neurodegenerative disease, and other age-related diseases. In this review we discuss how AA requirements are shaped and how ingested AAs regulate a spectrum of homeostatic processes. Finally, we highlight the resulting opportunity to develop nutritional strategies to improve human health during aging.

%X Proteins crucial for the respiratory chain are translated by the mitochondrial ribosome. Mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis is therefore critical for oxidative phosphorylation capacity and disturbances are known to cause human disease. This complex process is evolutionary conserved and involves several RNA processing and modification steps required for correct ribosomal RNA maturation. We recently showed that a member of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (MTERF) family of proteins, MTERF4, recruits NSUN4, a 5-methylcytosine RNA methyltransferase, to the large ribosomal subunit in a process crucial for mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. Here, we describe the 3D crystal structure of the human MTERF4-NSUN4 complex determined to 2.9 A resolution. MTERF4 is composed of structurally repeated MTERF-motifs that form a nucleic acid binding domain. NSUN4 lacks an N- or C-terminal extension that is commonly used for RNA recognition by related RNA methyltransferases. Instead, NSUN4 binds to the C-terminus of MTERF4. A positively charged surface forms an RNA binding path from the concave to the convex side of MTERF4 and further along NSUN4 all of the way into the active site. This finding suggests that both subunits of the protein complex likely contribute to RNA recognition. The interface between MTERF4 and NSUN4 contains evolutionarily conserved polar and hydrophobic amino acids, and mutations that change these residues completely disrupt complex formation. This study provides a molecular explanation for MTERF4-dependent recruitment of NSUN4 to ribosomal RNA and suggests a unique mechanism by which other members of the large MTERF-family of proteins can regulate ribosomal biogenesis.

%X LRPPRC is a protein that has attracted interest both for its role in post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and more recently because numerous mutated variants have been characterized as causing severe infantile mitochondrial neurodegeneration. LRPPRC belongs to the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family, originally defined by their RNA binding capacity, and forms a complex with SLIRP that harbours an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain. We show here that LRPPRC displays a broad and strong RNA binding capacity in vitro in contrast to SLIRP that associates only weakly with RNA. The LRPPRC-SLIRP complex comprises a hetero-dimer via interactions by polar amino acids in the single RRM domain of SLIRP and three neighbouring PPR motifs in the second quarter of LRPPRC, which critically contribute to the LRPPRC-SLIRP binding interface to enhance its stability. Unexpectedly, specific amino acids at this interface are located within the PPRs of LRPPRC at positions predicted to interact with RNA and within the RNP1 motif of SLIRP&apos;s RRM domain. Our findings thus unexpectedly establish that despite the prediction that these residues in LRPPRC and SLIRP should bind RNA, they are instead used to facilitate protein-protein interactions, enabling the formation of a stable complex between these two proteins.

%X In metazoan cells, spliced mRNAs are marked by the exon junction complex (EJC), a multi-protein complex that serves as a key regulator of post-transcriptional mRNA metabolism. Deposition of EJCs on mRNA is intimately linked to the splicing process. The spliceosomal protein CWC22 directly binds the core EJC-protein eIF4A3, guides it to the spliceosome and initiates EJC assembly. In addition, CWC22 is involved in the splicing process itself, but the molecular details of its dual function remain elusive. Here we analyze the mechanisms, by which CWC22 co-regulates pre-mRNA splicing and EJC assembly. We show that the core of CWC22 is sufficient to mediate both pre-mRNA splicing and EJC assembly. Nonetheless, both processes can be functionally uncoupled with an eIF4A3-binding deficient mutant of CWC22, which impedes EJC assembly. A C-terminal domain of CWC22 strongly enhances its spliceosomal interaction and likely regulates its function. High-throughput RNA-sequencing identifies global defects of pre-mRNA splicing and downregulation of diverse gene expression pathways in CWC22-depleted cells. We propose a model, in which CWC22 represents an integral component of the spliceosome and orchestrates pre-mRNA splicing and eIF4A3 binding to achieve global assembly of exon junction complexes.

%X Activation of orexigenic AgRP-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus potently promotes feeding, thus defining new regulators of AgRP neuron activity could uncover potential novel targets for obesity treatment. Here, we demonstrate that AgRP neurons express the purinergic receptor 6 (P2Y6), which is activated by uridine-diphosphate (UDP). In vivo, UDP induces ERK phosphorylation and cFos expression in AgRP neurons and promotes action potential firing of these neurons in brain slice recordings. Consequently, central application of UDP promotes feeding, and this response is abrogated upon pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of P2Y6 as well as upon pharmacogenetic inhibition of AgRP neuron activity. In obese animals, hypothalamic UDP content is elevated as a consequence of increased circulating uridine concentrations. Collectively, these experiments reveal a potential regulatory pathway in obesity, where peripheral uridine increases hypothalamic UDP concentrations, which in turn can promote feeding via PY6-dependent activation of AgRP neurons.

%X Prohibitins comprise a protein family in eukaryotic cells with potential roles in senescence and tumor suppression. Phb1p and Phb2p, members of the prohibitin family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been implicated in the regulation of the replicative life span of the cells and in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. The functional activities of these proteins, however, have not been elucidated. We demonstrate here that prohibitins regulate the turnover of membrane proteins by the m-AAA protease, a conserved ATP-dependent protease in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The m-AAA protease is composed of the homologous subunits Yta10p (Afg3p) and Yta12p (Rca1p). Deletion of PHB1 or PHB2 impairs growth of Deltayta10 or Deltayta12 cells but does not affect cell growth in the presence of the m-AAA protease. A prohibitin complex with a native molecular mass of approximately 2 MDa containing Phb1p and Phb2p forms a supercomplex with the m-AAA protease. Proteolysis of nonassembled inner membrane proteins by the m-AAA protease is accelerated in mitochondria lacking Phb1p or Phb2p, indicating a negative regulatory effect of prohibitins on m-AAA protease activity. These results functionally link members of two conserved protein families in eukaryotes to the degradation of membrane proteins in mitochondria.

%X A variety of observations support the hypothesis that deficiency of complex I [reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH):ubiquinone oxidoreductase] of the mitochondrial respiratory chain plays a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, recent data from a study using mice with knockout of the complex I subunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase iron-sulfur protein 4 (Ndufs4) has challenged this concept as these mice show degeneration of non-dopamine neurons. In addition, primary dopamine (DA) neurons derived from such mice, reported to lack complex I activity, remain sensitive to toxins believed to act through inhibition of complex I. We tissue-specifically disrupted the Ndufs4 gene in mouse heart and found an apparent severe deficiency of complex I activity in disrupted mitochondria, whereas oxidation of substrates that result in entry of electrons at the level of complex I was only mildly reduced in intact isolated heart mitochondria. Further analyses of detergent-solubilized mitochondria showed the mutant complex I to be unstable but capable of forming supercomplexes with complex I enzyme activity. The loss of Ndufs4 thus causes only a mild complex I deficiency in vivo. We proceeded to disrupt Ndufs4 in midbrain DA neurons and found no overt neurodegeneration, no loss of striatal innervation and no symptoms of Parkinsonism in tissue-specific knockout animals. However, DA homeostasis was abnormal with impaired DA release and increased levels of DA metabolites. Furthermore, Ndufs4 DA neuron knockouts were more vulnerable to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Taken together, these findings lend in vivo support to the hypothesis that complex I deficiency can contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction is heavily implicated in Parkinson disease (PD) as exemplified by the finding of an increased frequency of respiratory chain-deficient dopamine (DA) neurons in affected patients. An inherited form of PD is caused by impaired function of Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase reported to translocate to defective mitochondria in vitro to facilitate their clearance. We have developed a reporter mouse to assess mitochondrial morphology in DA neurons in vivo and show here that respiratory chain deficiency leads to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and to the formation of large cytoplasmic bodies derived from mitochondria. Surprisingly, the dysfunctional mitochondria do not recruit Parkin in vivo, and neither the clearance of defective mitochondria nor the neurodegeneration phenotype is affected by the absence of Parkin. We also show that anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria is impaired in respiratory chain-deficient DA neurons, leading to a decreased supply of mitochondria to the axonal terminals.

%X LRPPRC (also called LRP130) is an RNA-binding pentatricopeptide repeat protein. LRPPRC has been recognized as a mitochondrial protein, but has also been shown to regulate nuclear gene transcription and to bind specific RNA molecules in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We here present a bioinformatic analysis of the LRPPRC primary sequence, which reveals that orthologs to the LRPPRC gene are restricted to metazoan cells and that all of the corresponding proteins contain mitochondrial targeting signals. To address the subcellular localization further, we have carefully analyzed LRPPRC in mammalian cells and identified a single isoform that is exclusively localized to mitochondria. The LRPPRC protein is imported to the mitochondrial matrix and its mitochondrial targeting sequence is cleaved upon entry.

%X The biological response to DNA double-strand breaks acts to preserve genome integrity. Individuals bearing inactivating mutations in components of this response exhibit clinical symptoms that include cellular radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. The archetype for such disorders is Ataxia-Telangiectasia caused by biallelic mutation in ATM, a central component of the DNA damage response. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is mutated in the RIDDLE syndrome, a recently discovered immunodeficiency and radiosensitivity disorder. We show that RNF168 is recruited to sites of DNA damage by binding to ubiquitylated histone H2A. RNF168 acts with UBC13 to amplify the RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitylation by targeting H2A-type histones and by promoting the formation of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates. These RNF168-dependent chromatin modifications orchestrate the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to DNA lesions, and their loss is the likely cause of the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with RIDDLE syndrome.

%X Somatic mutations in the nuclear genome are required for tumor formation, but the functional consequences of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are less understood. Here we identify somatic mtDNA mutations across 527 tumors and 14 cancer types, using an approach that takes advantage of evidence from both genomic and transcriptomic sequencing. We find that there is selective pressure against deleterious coding mutations, supporting that functional mitochondria are required in tumor cells, and also observe a strong mutational strand bias, compatible with endogenous replication-coupled errors as the major source of mutations. Interestingly, while allelic ratios in general were consistent in RNA compared to DNA, some mutations in tRNAs displayed strong allelic imbalances caused by accumulation of unprocessed tRNA precursors. The effect was explained by altered secondary structure, demonstrating that correct tRNA folding is a major determinant for processing of polycistronic mitochondrial transcripts. Additionally, the data suggest that tRNA clusters are preferably processed in the 3' to 5' direction. Our study gives insights into mtDNA function in cancer and answers questions regarding mitochondrial tRNA biogenesis that are difficult to address in controlled experimental systems.

%X The mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster is thought to be transcribed in about five polycistronic primary transcripts, which are processed into 11 mRNA, 22 tRNA and two rRNA species required for the genome's function. The tRNA punctuation model has been proposed to predict the cleavage sites used in this process. In this model, tRNAs are removed from the primary transcripts and the fragments that remain become mRNA and rRNA transcripts. Thus the 5' and 3' ends of the major gene transcripts are defined by the endpoints of the intervening tRNA sequences. We used 5' and 3' RACE, and circularization and RT-PCR methods to determine the sequences of both ends of all major gene transcripts of the D. melanogaster mitochondrial genome. In general, the tRNA punctuation model accurately predicts the 3' ends of most mRNA and rRNA molecules, even where there are non-coding residues present. Non-coding residues at the 5' end are evidently removed during RNA processing. The mRNAs begin precisely at the start codon for each gene. In particular, the 5' end of the cox1 gene is the first in-frame sense codon, UCG, implying that this codon serves as the start. In-frame TAA stop codons immediately preceding both the cox1 and cox2 genes may serve to prevent in-frame translation of these genes prior to the completion of processing, and are removed from the mature transcripts. Where multiple tRNA genes are present, as between nad3 and nad5, they are removed sequentially in a 3' to 5' direction.

%X Common genetic variants of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) increase the risk of developing several of the major health issues facing the western world, including neurodegenerative diseases. In this Review, we consider how these mtDNA variants arose and how they spread from their origin on one single molecule in a single cell to be present at high levels throughout a specific organ and, ultimately, to contribute to the population risk of common age-related disorders. mtDNA persists in all aerobic eukaryotes, despite a high substitution rate, clonal propagation and little evidence of recombination. Recent studies have found that de novo mtDNA mutations are suppressed in the female germ line; despite this, mtDNA heteroplasmy is remarkably common. The demonstration of a mammalian mtDNA genetic bottleneck explains how new germline variants can increase to high levels within a generation, and the ultimate fixation of less-severe mutations that escape germline selection explains how they can contribute to the risk of late-onset disorders.

%X Mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are frequent in humans and are implicated in many different types of pathology. The high substitution rate and the maternal, asexual mode of transmission of mtDNA make it more likely to accumulate deleterious mutations. Here, we discuss recent evidence that mtDNA transmission is subject to strong purifying selection in the mammalian female germ line, limiting the accumulation of such mutations. This process shapes mitochondrial sequence diversity and is therefore probably of fundamental importance for animal evolution and in human mitochondrial disease.

%X There is an intense debate concerning whether selection or demographics has been most important in shaping the sequence variation observed in modern human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Purifying selection is thought to be important in shaping mtDNA sequence evolution, but the strength of this selection has been debated, mainly due to the threshold effect of pathogenic mtDNA mutations and an observed excess of new mtDNA mutations in human population data. We experimentally addressed this issue by studying the maternal transmission of random mtDNA mutations in mtDNA mutator mice expressing a proofreading-deficient mitochondrial DNA polymerase. We report a rapid and strong elimination of nonsynonymous changes in protein-coding genes; the hallmark of purifying selection. There are striking similarities between the mutational patterns in our experimental mouse system and human mtDNA polymorphisms. These data show strong purifying selection against mutations within mtDNA protein-coding genes. To our knowledge, our study presents the first direct experimental observations of the fate of random mtDNA mutations in the mammalian germ line and demonstrates the importance of purifying selection in shaping mitochondrial sequence diversity.

%X Since the unexpected discovery that mitochondria contain their own distinct DNA molecules, studies of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have yielded many surprises. In animals, transmission of the mtDNA genome is explicitly non-Mendelian, with a very high number of genome copies being inherited from the mother after a drastic bottleneck. Recent work has begun to uncover the molecular details of this unusual mode of transmission. Many surprising variations in animal mitochondrial biology are known; however, a series of recent studies have identified a core of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms relating to mtDNA inheritance, e.g., mtDNA bottlenecks during germ cell development, selection against specific mtDNA mutation types during maternal transmission, and targeted destruction of sperm mitochondria. In this review, we outline recent literature on the transmission of mtDNA in animals and highlight the implications for human health and ageing.

%X A plasmid with a size of 2,682 base pairs isolated from the Yersinia enterocolitica biogroup 1A strain # 29807 was characterized in respect to its suitability as a basic replicon for cloning vectors. The copy number of the plasmid was determined to be approximately 14 copies per cell and it was shown to be compatible with vectors with an origin of replication derived from ColE1 and p115A. The replication region of the plasmid encodes a primer RNAI and countertranscript RNAII. Two vectors, pIV1 and pIV2, containing a kanamycin resistance gene and the lacZalpha fragment with the multiple cloning site of pBluescriptSK + were constructed. A mobilizable derivative was successfully introduced into different bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriacea. To prove the applicability of the novel vectors for cloning purposes, a 13 kb hemolysin operon of Escherichia coli was inserted into pIV1, and the resulting recombinant plasmid was stably maintained and expressed in E. coli and Y. enterocolitica.

%X The National Institute on Aging Interventions Testing Program (ITP) evaluates agents hypothesized to increase healthy lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice. Each compound is tested in parallel at three sites, and all results are published. We report the effects of lifelong treatment of mice with four agents not previously tested: Protandim, fish oil, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and metformin - the latter with and without rapamycin, and two drugs previously examined: 17-alpha-estradiol and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), at doses greater and less than used previously. 17-alpha-estradiol at a threefold higher dose robustly extended both median and maximal lifespan, but still only in males. The male-specific extension of median lifespan by NDGA was replicated at the original dose, and using doses threefold lower and higher. The effects of NDGA were dose dependent and male specific but without an effect on maximal lifespan. Protandim, a mixture of botanical extracts that activate Nrf2, extended median lifespan in males only. Metformin alone, at a dose of 0.1% in the diet, did not significantly extend lifespan. Metformin (0.1%) combined with rapamycin (14 ppm) robustly extended lifespan, suggestive of an added benefit, based on historical comparison with earlier studies of rapamycin given alone. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, at a concentration previously tested (1000 ppm), significantly increased median longevity in males and 90th percentile lifespan in both sexes, even when treatment was started at 16 months. Neither fish oil nor UDCA extended lifespan. These results underscore the reproducibility of ITP longevity studies and illustrate the importance of identifying optimal doses in lifespan studies.

%X Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta deposition in amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits. Cannabinoids display neuromodulatory and neuroprotective effects and affect memory acquisition. Here, we studied the impact of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) deficiency on the development of AD pathology by breeding amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutant mice (APP23), an AD animal model, with CB1-deficient mice. In addition to the lower body weight of APP23/CB1(-/-) mice, most of these mice died at an age before typical AD-associated changes become apparent. The surviving mice showed a reduced amount of APP and its fragments suggesting a regulatory influence of CB1 on APP processing, which was confirmed by modulating CB1 expression in vitro. Reduced APP levels were accompanied by a reduced plaque load and less inflammation in APP23/CB1(-/-) mice. Nevertheless, compared to APP23 mice with an intact CB1, APP23/CB1(-/-) mice showed impaired learning and memory deficits. These data argue against a direct correlation of amyloid plaque load with cognitive abilities in this AD mouse model lacking CB1. Furthermore, the findings indicate that CB1 deficiency can worsen AD-related cognitive deficits and support a potential role of CB1 as a pharmacologic target.

%X Prohibitins are highly conserved proteins mainly implicated in the maintenance of mitochondrial function and architecture. Their dysfunctions are associated with aging, cancer, obesity, and inflammation. However, their possible role in pancreatic beta-cells remains unknown. The current study documents the expression of prohibitins in human and rodent islets and their key role for beta-cell function and survival. Ablation of Phb2 in mouse beta-cells sequentially resulted in impairment of mitochondrial function and insulin secretion, loss of beta-cells, progressive alteration of glucose homeostasis, and, ultimately, severe diabetes. Remarkably, these events progressed over a 3-week period of time after weaning. Defective insulin supply in beta-Phb2(-/-) mice was contributed by both beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis, temporarily compensated by increased beta-cell proliferation. At the molecular level, we observed that deletion of Phb2 caused mitochondrial abnormalities, including reduction of mitochondrial DNA copy number and respiratory chain complex IV levels, altered mitochondrial activity, cleavage of L-optic atrophy 1, and mitochondrial fragmentation. Overall, our data demonstrate that Phb2 is essential for metabolic activation of mitochondria and, as a consequence, for function and survival of beta-cells.

%X Molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 class bind unfolded polypeptide chains and are thought to be involved in the cellular folding pathway of many proteins. DnaK, the Hsp70 protein of Escherichia coli, is regulated by the chaperone protein DnaJ and the cofactor GrpE. To gain a biologically relevant understanding of the mechanism of Hsp70 action, we have analyzed a model reaction in which DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE mediate the folding of denatured firefly luciferase. The binding and release of substrate protein for folding involves the following ATP hydrolysis-dependent cycle: (i) unfolded luciferase binds initially to DnaJ; (ii) upon interaction with luciferase-DnaJ, DnaK hydrolyzes its bound ATP, resulting in the formation of a stable luciferase-DnaK-DnaJ complex; (iii) GrpE releases ADP from DnaK; and (iv) ATP binding to DnaK triggers the release of substrate protein, thus completing the reaction cycle. A single cycle of binding and release leads to folding of only a fraction of luciferase molecules. Several rounds of ATP-dependent interaction with DnaK and DnaJ are required for fully efficient folding.

%X Posttranslational modification with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) alters the function of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. SUMO-specific enzymes conjugate SUMOs to lysine residues in target proteins. Although proteomic studies have identified hundreds of sumoylated substrates, methods to identify the modified lysines on a proteomic scale are lacking. We developed a method that enabled proteome-wide identification of sumoylated lysines that involves the expression of polyhistidine (6His)-tagged SUMO2 with Thr(90) mutated to Lys. Endoproteinase cleavage with Lys-C of 6His-SUMO2(T90K)-modified proteins from human cell lysates produced a diGly remnant on SUMO2(T90K)-conjugated lysines, enabling immunoprecipitation of SUMO2(T90K)-modified peptides and producing a unique mass-to-charge signature. Mass spectrometry analysis of SUMO-enriched peptides revealed more than 1000 sumoylated lysines in 539 proteins, including many functionally related proteins involved in cell cycle, transcription, and DNA repair. Not only can this strategy be used to study the dynamics of sumoylation and other potentially similar posttranslational modifications, but also, these data provide an unprecedented resource for future research on the role of sumoylation in cellular physiology and disease.

%X The protein called 'small ubiquitin-like modifier' (SUMO) is post-translationally linked to target proteins at the varepsilon-amino group of lysine residues. This 'SUMOylation' alters the behavior of the target protein, a change that is utilized to regulate diverse cellular processes. Understanding the target-specific consequences of SUMO modification requires knowledge of the location of conjugation sites, and we have developed a straightforward protocol for the proteome-wide identification of SUMO modification sites using mass spectrometry (MS). The approach described herein requires the expression of a mutant form of SUMO, in which the residue preceding the C-terminal Gly-Gly (diGly) is replaced with a lysine (SUMO(KGG)). Digestion of SUMO(KGG) protein conjugates with endoproteinase Lys-C yields a diGly motif attached to target lysines. Peptides containing this adduct are enriched using a diGly-Lys (K-varepsilon-GG)-specific antibody and identified by MS. This diGly signature is characteristic of SUMO(KGG) conjugation alone, as no other ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) yields this adduct upon Lys-C digestion. We have demonstrated the utility of the approach in SUMOylation studies, but, in principle, it may be adapted for the site-specific identification of proteins modified by any Ubl. Starting from cell lysis, this protocol can be completed in approximately 5 d.

%X The control of motor behavior in animals and humans requires constant adaptation of neuronal networks to signals of various types and strengths. We found that microRNA-128 (miR-128), which is expressed in adult neurons, regulates motor behavior by modulating neuronal signaling networks and excitability. miR-128 governs motor activity by suppressing the expression of various ion channels and signaling components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK2 network that regulate neuronal excitability. In mice, a reduction of miR-128 expression in postnatal neurons causes increased motor activity and fatal epilepsy. Overexpression of miR-128 attenuates neuronal responsiveness, suppresses motor activity, and alleviates motor abnormalities associated with Parkinson's-like disease and seizures in mice. These data suggest a therapeutic potential for miR-128 in the treatment of epilepsy and movement disorders.

%X Reduced signaling of insulin-like peptides increases the life-span of nematodes, flies, and rodents. In the nematode and the fly, secondary hormones downstream of insulin-like signaling appear to regulate aging. In mammals, the order in which the hormones act is unresolved because insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, and thyroid hormones are interdependent. In all species examined to date, endocrine manipulations can slow aging without concurrent costs in reproduction, but with inevitable increases in stress resistance. Despite the similarities among mammals and invertebrates in insulin-like peptides and their signal cascade, more research is needed to determine whether these signals control aging in the same way in all the species by the same mechanism.

%X The small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) alter the functions of diverse cellular proteins by covalent posttranslational modification and thus influence many cellular functions, including gene transcription, cell cycle, and DNA repair. Although conjugation by ubiquitin and SUMO-2/3 are largely functionally and mechanistically independent from one another, both appear to increase under conditions of proteasome inhibition. To better understand the relationship between SUMO and protein degradation by the proteasome, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of SUMO-2 substrates after short- and long-term inhibition of the proteasome with MG132. Comparisons with changes to the SUMO-2 conjugate subproteome in response to heat stress revealed qualitative and quantitative parallels between both conditions; however, in contrast to heat stress, the MG132-triggered increase in SUMO-2 conjugation depended strictly on protein synthesis, implying that the accumulation of newly synthesized, misfolded proteins destined for degradation by the proteasome triggered the SUMO conjugation response. Furthermore, proteasomal inhibition resulted in the accumulation of conjugated forms of all SUMO paralogs in insoluble protein inclusions and in the accumulation on SUMO-2 substrates of lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are not thought to serve as signals for proteasome-mediated degradation. Together, these findings suggest multiple, proteasome-independent roles for SUMOs in the cellular response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins.

%X Maturation of cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) in mitochondria occurs by the subsequent action of two conserved proteases in the inner membrane: the m-AAA protease, an ATP-dependent protease degrading misfolded proteins and mediating protein processing, and the rhomboid protease Pcp1, an intramembrane cleaving peptidase. Neither the determinants preventing complete proteolysis of certain substrates by the m-AAA protease, nor the obligatory requirement of the m-AAA protease for rhomboid cleavage is currently understood. Here, we describe an intimate and unexpected functional interplay of both proteases. The m-AAA protease mediates the ATP-dependent membrane dislocation of Ccp1 independent of its proteolytic activity. It thereby ensures the correct positioning of Ccp1 within the membrane bilayer allowing intramembrane cleavage by rhomboid. Decreasing the hydrophobicity of the Ccp1 transmembrane segment facilitates its dislocation from the membrane and renders rhomboid cleavage m-AAA protease-independent. These findings reveal for the first time a non-proteolytic function of the m-AAA protease during mitochondrial biogenesis and rationalise the requirement of a preceding step for intramembrane cleavage by rhomboid.

%X Mitochondria are dynamic organelles with activities that adjust to altering physiological conditions and variable metabolic demands. A conserved proteolytic system present within the organelle exerts essential functions during the biogenesis of mitochondria and ensures the maintenance of organellar activities under varying conditions. Proteases dependent on adenosine triphosphate, in concert with oligopeptidases, degrade nonassembled or damaged proteins in various subcompartments of mitochondria, preventing their accumulation and possibly deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions. Although an increasing number of mitochondrial peptidases are characterized and functionally linked to diverse cellular processes, only limited information is available on the stability of the mitochondrial proteome and the turnover rates of individual proteins. We describe experimental approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in mice, allowing analysis of the proteolytic breakdown of mitochondrial proteins individually or on a proteomewide scale.

%X Dysfunction of mitochondria has severe cellular consequences and is linked to ageing and neurodegeneration in human. Several surveillance strategies have evolved that limit mitochondrial damage and ensure cellular integrity. Intraorganellar proteases conduct protein quality control and exert regulatory functions, membrane fusion and fission allow mitochondrial content mixing within a cell, and the autophagic degradation of severely damaged mitochondria protects against apoptosis. Here, we will summarize the current knowledge on these surveillance strategies and their role in human disease.

%X Mitochondrial functions and architecture rely on a defined lipid composition of their outer and inner membranes, which are characterized by a high content of non-bilayer phospholipids such as cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Mitochondrial membrane lipids are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or within mitochondria from ER-derived precursor lipids, are asymmetrically distributed within mitochondria and can relocate in response to cellular stress. Maintenance of lipid homeostasis thus requires multiple lipid transport processes to be orchestrated within mitochondria. Recent findings identified members of the Ups/PRELI family as specific lipid transfer proteins in mitochondria that shuttle phospholipids between mitochondrial membranes. They cooperate with membrane organizing proteins that preserve the spatial organization of mitochondrial membranes and the formation of membrane contact sites, unravelling an intimate crosstalk of membrane lipid transport and homeostasis with the structural organization of mitochondria. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Lipids of Mitochondria edited by Guenther Daum.

%X Prohibitins comprise a remarkably conserved protein family in eukaryotic cells with proposed functions in cell cycle progression, senescence, apoptosis, and the regulation of mitochondrial activities. Two prohibitin homologues, Phb1 and Phb2, assemble into a high molecular weight complex of approximately 1.2 MDa in the mitochondrial inner membrane, but a nuclear localization of Phb1 and Phb2 also has been reported. Here, we have analyzed the biogenesis and structure of the prohibitin complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both Phb1 and Phb2 subunits are targeted to mitochondria by unconventional noncleavable targeting sequences at their amino terminal end. Membrane insertion involves binding of newly imported Phb1 to Tim8/13 complexes in the intermembrane space and is mediated by the TIM23-translocase. Assembly occurs via intermediate-sized complexes of approximately 120 kDa containing both Phb1 and Phb2. Conserved carboxy-terminal coiled-coil regions in both subunits mediate the formation of large assemblies in the inner membrane. Single particle electron microscopy of purified prohibitin complexes identifies diverse ring-shaped structures with outer dimensions of approximately 270 x 200 angstroms. Implications of these findings for proposed cellular activities of prohibitins are discussed.

%X Mitochondria are dynamic organelles surrounded by two membranes with a defined lipid composition. The majority of lipids are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the mitochondria, but the synthesis of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner membrane of mitochondria highlights their general importance for cellular lipid metabolism. Extensive exchange of lipids and their precursors occurs between the ER and mitochondria as well as between mitochondrial membranes. The recent identification of membrane-tethering complexes and lipid-transfer proteins in mitochondria now provides the first insight into the mechanisms of these transport processes, which are of fundamental importance for mitochondrial activities and cell homeostasis. Here, we summarize the current understanding of lipid trafficking at the mitochondria and discuss emerging models for the mechanisms of lipid transfer.

%X The yeast gene, YTA10, encodes a member of a novel family of putative ATPases. Yta10p, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence, is 761 amino acids in length (predicted molecular mass 84.5 kDa). The amino acid sequence of Yta10p exhibits high similarity to two other yeast proteins, Yta11 and Yta12, and to E. coli FtsH. Several features of Yta10p are compatible with its localization in mitochondria. We report here that Yta10p is a yeast mitochondrial protein and that import is dependent on a membrane potential and accompanied by processing to a protein of approximately 73 kDa. Disruption of YTA10 leads to a nuclear petite phenotype and to a loss of respiratory competence, as shown by spectrophotometric measurement of the activities of respiratory complexes I-III and IV, respectively. These findings together with the high similarity of Yta10p to several ATP-dependent proteases suggest that Yta10p is a mitochondrial component involved, directly or indirectly, in the correct assembly and/or maintenance of active respiratory complexes.

%X PIM1 protease in mitochondria belongs to a conserved family of ATP-dependent proteases, which includes the Escherichia coli Lon protease. Yeast cells lacking PIM1 are largely defective in degrading misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix, are respiratory deficient, and lose integrity of mitochondrial DNA. In order to analyze whether E. coli Lon protease is functionally equivalent to mitochondrial PIM1 protease, yeast cells lacking the PIM1 gene were transformed with a construct consisting of a mitochondrial targeting sequence fused onto the Lon protease. In these cells, the fusion protein was expressed and imported into mitochondria, and the targeting sequence was removed. In the absence of PIM1 protease, the E. coli Lon protease mediated the degradation of misfolded proteins in the matrix space in cooperation with the mitochondrial hsp70 system. These cells maintained the integrity of the mitochondrial genome and the respiratory function at 30 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C. Stabilization of mitochondrial DNA in Deltapim1 cells depended on protein degradation by the E. coli Lon protease, as a proteolytically inactive Lon variant was not capable of substituting for a loss of PIM1 protease. These results demonstrate functional conservation of Lon-like proteases from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and shed new light on the role of Lon-like proteases in mitochondrial biogenesis.

%X Respiratory diseases are highly prevalent and affect humankind worldwide, causing extensive morbidity and mortality with the environment playing an important role. Given the complex structure of the airways, sophisticated tools are required for early diagnosis; initial symptoms are nonspecific, and the clinical diagnosis is made frequently late. Over the past few years, proteomics has made high technological progress in mass-spectrometry-based protein identification and has allowed us to gain new insights into disease mechanisms and identify potential novel therapeutic targets. This review will highlight the contributions of proteomics toward the understanding of the respiratory proteome listing potential biomarkers and its potential application to the clinic. We also outline the contributions of proteomics to creating a personalized approach in respiratory medicine.

%X BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Influenza viruses cause respiratory infection in humans and result in substantial illness, death, and economic burden. To date, however, the mechanisms by which these viruses cause disease are not fully understood. METHODS: To investigate the proteomic profile of children infected with seasonal influenza A virus, nasal aspirates derived from children (n = 12) experiencing flu symptoms caused by seasonal influenza A virus were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Control nasal samples were taken from the same group of children 8-10 weeks later when they were symptom free. RESULTS: Analysis of the 2-DE gels revealed eight spots differentially expressed, which were further analyzed using mass spectrometry. Ten proteins were found to be differentially upregulated in the infected children including PLUNC, cystatin S, cystatin SA, S100A9, lipocalin 1 fragments (n = 2), truncated lactotransferrin, two immunoglobulin (Ig) kappa fragments and one immunoglobulin (Ig) lambda fragment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that the composition of nasal secretions in influenza virus respiratory infections is different from that when children are healthy and may provide further insights into the pathogenesis of respiratory infections caused by seasonal influenza A viruses.

%X Mitochondrial transcription termination factor 1, MTERF1, has been reported to couple rRNA gene transcription initiation with termination and is therefore thought to be a key regulator of mammalian mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. The prevailing model is based on a series of observations published over the last two decades, but no in vivo evidence exists to show that MTERF1 regulates transcription of the heavy-strand region of mtDNA containing the rRNA genes. Here, we demonstrate that knockout of Mterf1 in mice has no effect on mitochondrial rRNA levels or mitochondrial translation. Instead, loss of Mterf1 influences transcription initiation at the light-strand promoter, resulting in a decrease of de novo transcription manifested as reduced 7S RNA levels. Based on these observations, we suggest that MTERF1 does not regulate heavy-strand transcription, but rather acts to block transcription on the opposite strand of mtDNA to prevent transcription interference at the light-strand promoter.

%X Post-translational modifications of histones regulate all DNA-templated processes, including replication, transcription and repair. These modifications function as platforms for the recruitment of specific effector proteins, such as transcriptional regulators or chromatin remodellers. Recent data suggest that histone modifications also have a direct effect on nucleosomal architecture. Acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and citrullination of the histone core may influence chromatin structure by affecting histone-histone and histone-DNA interactions, as well as the binding of histones to chaperones.

%X The oligomeric AAA+ chaperone Hsp104 is essential for thermotolerance development and prion propagation in yeast. Thermotolerance relies on the ability of Hsp104 to cooperate with the Hsp70 chaperone system in the reactivation of heat-aggregated proteins. Prion propagation requires the Hsp104-dependent fragmentation of prion fibrils to create infectious seeds. It remained elusive whether both processes rely on common or different activities of Hsp104. Specifically, protein reactivation has been suggested to require a substrate threading activity of Hsp104 whereas fibril fragmentation may be mediated by a crowbar activity. Here we engineered an Hsp104 variant, HAP, which cooperates with the bacterial peptidase ClpP to form a novel proteolytic system. HAP threads aggregated model substrates as well as the yeast prion Sup35 through its central pore into associated ClpP. HAP variants that harbour a reduced threading activity were affected in both protein disaggregation and prion propagation, demonstrating that substrate threading represents the common mechanism for the processing of both substrate classes.

%X Nucleosomes are decorated with numerous post-translational modifications capable of influencing many DNA processes. Here we describe a new class of histone modification, methylation of glutamine, occurring on yeast histone H2A at position 105 (Q105) and human H2A at Q104. We identify Nop1 as the methyltransferase in yeast and demonstrate that fibrillarin is the orthologue enzyme in human cells. Glutamine methylation of H2A is restricted to the nucleolus. Global analysis in yeast, using an H2AQ105me-specific antibody, shows that this modification is exclusively enriched over the 35S ribosomal DNA transcriptional unit. We show that the Q105 residue is part of the binding site for the histone chaperone FACT (facilitator of chromatin transcription) complex. Methylation of Q105 or its substitution to alanine disrupts binding to FACT in vitro. A yeast strain mutated at Q105 shows reduced histone incorporation and increased transcription at the ribosomal DNA locus. These features are phenocopied by mutations in FACT complex components. Together these data identify glutamine methylation of H2A as the first histone epigenetic mark dedicated to a specific RNA polymerase and define its function as a regulator of FACT interaction with nucleosomes.

%X The yeast AAA(+) chaperone Hsp104 is essential for the development of thermotolerance and for the inheritance of prions. Recently, Hsp104, together with the actin cytoskeleton, has been implicated in the asymmetric distribution of carbonylated proteins. Here, we investigated the interplay between Hsp104 and actin by using a dominant-negative variant of Hsp104 (HAP/ClpP) that degrades substrate proteins instead of remodeling them. Coexpression of HAP/ClpP causes defects in morphology and the actin cytoskeleton. Taking a candidate approach, we identified Spa2, a member of the polarisome complex, as an Hsp104 substrate. Furthermore, we provided genetic evidence that links Spa2 and Hsp104 to Hof1, a member of the cytokinesis machinery. Spa2 and Hof1 knockout cells are affected in the asymmetric distribution of damaged proteins, suggesting that Hsp104, Spa2, and Hof1 are members of a network controlling the inheritance of carbonylated proteins.

%X Hormonal signals can modulate lifespan and reproductive capacity across the animal kingdom. The use of model organisms such as worms, flies and mice has been fundamentally important for aging research in the discovery of genetic alterations that can extend healthy lifespan. The effects of mutations in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-like signaling (IIS) pathways are evolutionarily conserved in that they can increase lifespan in all three animal models. Additionally, steroids and other lipophilic signaling molecules modulate lifespan in diverse organisms. Here we shall review how major hormonal pathways in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster interact to influence reproductive capacity and aging.

%X Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, the morphology of which results from an equilibrium between two opposing processes, fusion and fission. Mitochondrial fusion relies on dynamin-related GTPases, the mitofusins (MFN1 and 2) in the outer mitochondrial membrane and OPA1 (optic atrophy 1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Apart from a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA, little is known about the physiological role of mitochondrial fusion. Here we report that mitochondria hyperfuse and form a highly interconnected network in cells exposed to selective stresses. This process precedes mitochondrial fission when it is triggered by apoptotic stimuli such as UV irradiation or actinomycin D. Stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (SIMH) is independent of MFN2, BAX/BAK, and prohibitins, but requires L-OPA1, MFN1, and the mitochondrial inner membrane protein SLP-2. In the absence of SLP-2, L-OPA1 is lost and SIMH is prevented. SIMH is accompanied by increased mitochondrial ATP production and represents a novel adaptive pro-survival response against stress.

%X Synergy in the downstream signaling pathways of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and the integrin alphavbeta3 is critical for blood vessel formation. Thus, agents that activate both receptors could possess efficient pro-angiogenic potential. Here, we created a fibrin-binding bi-functional protein (FNIII10-VEGF) consisting of the 10th type III domain of fibronectin (FNIII10) fused to a plasmin-resistant VEGF-A165 mutant (VEGF) that potentiated angiogenic processes when compared to the effect of the separate molecules. FNIII10-VEGF was able to bind both VEGFR-2 and integrin alphavbeta3. Intriguingly, cell attachment and spreading to immobilized FNIII10-VEGF was significantly enhanced compared to individual FNIII10 or VEGF proteins. Delivery of immobilized FNIII10-VEGF by covalent linkage to a fibrin matrix significantly enhanced the angiogenic response in an in vivo wound healing assay compared to soluble VEGF. Unexpectedly, the angiogenic response to fibrin-immobilized FNIII10-VEGF was reduced in comparison to the pro-angiogenic effect of fibrin-immobilized VEGF. Collectively, findings of this study corroborate a critical role for a subtle balance of the integrin-VEGF interplay in angiogenesis and provide insight in how engineered growth factors in concert with biomaterial matrices may offer a potent molecular/material approach to harness these interactions for therapeutic angiogenesis.

%X Amino acids regulate TOR complex 1 (TORC1) via two counteracting mechanisms, one activating and one inactivating. The presence of amino acids causes TORC1 recruitment to lysosomes where TORC1 is activated by binding Rheb. How the absence of amino acids inactivates TORC1 is less well understood. Amino acid starvation recruits the TSC1/TSC2 complex to the vicinity of TORC1 to inhibit Rheb; however, the upstream mechanisms regulating TSC2 are not known. We identify here the eIF4A-containing eIF4F translation initiation complex as an upstream regulator of TSC2 in response to amino acid withdrawal in Drosophila We find that TORC1 and translation preinitiation complexes bind each other. Cells lacking eIF4F components retain elevated TORC1 activity upon amino acid removal. This effect is specific for eIF4F and not a general consequence of blocked translation. This study identifies specific components of the translation machinery as important mediators of TORC1 inactivation upon amino acid removal.

%X Glucose homeostasis depends on adequate control of insulin secretion. We report the association of the cell-adhesion and adiponectin (APN)-binding glycoprotein T-cadherin (Cdh13) with insulin granules in mouse and human beta-cells. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of islets in situ and targeting of RFP-tagged T-cadherin to GFP-labeled insulin granules in isolated beta-cells demonstrate this unusual location. Analyses of T-cadherin-deficient (Tcad-KO) mice show normal islet architecture and insulin content. However, T-cadherin is required for sufficient insulin release in vitro and in vivo. Primary islets from Tcad-KO mice were defective in glucose-induced but not KCl-mediated insulin secretion. In vivo, second phase insulin release in T-cad-KO mice during a hyperglycemic clamp was impaired while acute first phase release was unaffected. Tcad-KO mice showed progressive glucose intolerance by 5 mo of age without concomitant changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity. Our analyses detected no association of APN with T-cadherin on beta-cell granules although colocalization was observed on the pancreatic vasculature. These data identify T-cadherin as a novel component of insulin granules and suggest that T-cadherin contributes to the regulation of insulin secretion independently of direct interactions with APN.

%X UBTD1 is a previously uncharacterized ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain containing protein with high homology to the mitochondrial Dc-UbP/UBTD2 protein. Here we show that UBTD1 and UBTD2 belong to a family of proteins that is conserved through evolution and found in metazoa, funghi, and plants. To gain further insight into the function of UBTD1, we screened for interacting proteins. In a yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screen, we identified several proteins involved in the ubiquitylation pathway, including the UBE2D family of E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes. An affinity capture screen for UBTD1 interacting proteins in whole cell extracts also identified members of the UBE2D family. Biochemical characterization of recombinant UBTD1 and UBE2D demonstrated that the two proteins form a stable, stoichiometric complex that can be purified to near homogeneity. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS).

%X Recently, MGME1 was identified as a mitochondrial DNA nuclease with preference for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates. Loss-of-function mutations in patients lead to mitochondrial disease with DNA depletion, deletions, duplications and rearrangements. Here, we assess the biochemical role of MGME1 in the processing of flap intermediates during mitochondrial DNA replication using reconstituted systems. We show that MGME1 can cleave flaps to enable efficient ligation of newly replicated DNA strands in combination with POLγ. MGME1 generates a pool of imprecisely cut products (short flaps, nicks and gaps) that are converted to ligatable nicks by POLγ through extension or excision of the 3&apos;-end strand. This is dependent on the 3&apos;-5&apos; exonuclease activity of POLγ which limits strand displacement activity and enables POLγ to back up to the nick by 3&apos;-5&apos; degradation. We also demonstrate that POLγ-driven strand displacement is sufficient to generate DNA- but not RNA-flap substrates suitable for MGME1 cleavage and ligation during replication. Our findings have implications for RNA primer removal models, the 5&apos;-end processing of nascent DNA at OriH, and DNA repair.

%X Lifespan is a remarkably diverse trait ranging from a few days to several hundred years in nature, but the mechanisms underlying the evolution of lifespan differences remain elusive. Here we de novo assemble a reference genome for the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish, providing a unique resource for comparative and experimental genomics. The identification of genes under positive selection in this fish reveals potential candidates to explain its compressed lifespan. Several aging genes are under positive selection in this short-lived fish and long-lived species, raising the intriguing possibility that the same gene could underlie evolution of both compressed and extended lifespans. Comparative genomics and linkage analysis identify candidate genes associated with lifespan differences between various turquoise killifish strains. Remarkably, these genes are clustered on the sex chromosome, suggesting that short lifespan might have co-evolved with sex determination. Our study provides insights into the evolutionary forces that shape lifespan in nature.

%X Members of the Hsp100/Clp-family of molecular chaperones form regulatory subunits of ATP-dependent Clp proteases and fulfill crucial roles for cellular thermotolerance. We have identified a Clp-like protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mcx1p, which shares approximately 30% sequence identity with ClpX-proteins in bacteria, plants and nematodes. Mcx1p localizes to the matrix space of mitochondria and is peripherally associated with the inner membrane. A homologue of E. coli ClpP protease was not identified when screening the yeast genome. We therefore propose that Mcx1p represents a novel molecular chaperone of mitochondria with non-proteolytic function.

%X Regulated protein degradation by ATP-dependent proteases plays a fundamental role in the biogenesis of mitochondria. Membrane-bound and soluble ATP-dependent proteases have been identified in various subcompartments of this organelle. Subunits composing these proteases are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and, in support of an endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria, evolved from prokaryotic ancestors: the PIM1/Lon protease is active in the matrix of mitochondria, while the i-AAA protease and the m-AAA protease mediate the turnover of inner membrane proteins. Most of the knowledge concerning the biogenesis and the physiological role of ATP-dependent proteases comes from studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Proteases were found to be required for mitochondrial stasis, for the maintenance of the morphology of the organelle and for mitochondrial genome integrity. ATP-dependent proteolysis is crucial for the expression of mitochondrially encoded subunits of respiratory chain complexes and for the assembly of these complexes. Hence, mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteases exert multiple roles which are essential for the maintenance of cellular respiratory competence.

%X The ATP-dependent PIM1 protease, a Lon-like protease localized in the mitochondrial matrix, is required for mitochondrial genome integrity in yeast. Cells lacking PIM1 accumulate lesions in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and therefore lose respiratory competence. The identification of a multicopy suppressor, which stabilizes mtDNA in the absence of PIM1, enabled us to characterize novel functions of PIM1 protease during mitochondrial biogenesis. The synthesis of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CoxI) and cytochrome b (Cob) is impaired in pim1 mutants containing mtDNA. PIM1-mediated proteolysis is required for the translation of mature COXI mRNA. Moreover, deficiencies in the splicing of COXI and COB transcripts, which appear to be restricted to introns encoding mRNA maturases, were observed in cells lacking the PIM1 gene. Transcripts of COXI and COB genes harboring multiple introns are degraded in the absence of PIM1. These results establish multiple, essential functions of the ATP-dependent PIM1 protease during mitochondrial gene expression.

%X Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a highly conserved homeostasis and quality control process critically linked to neurodegeneration, metabolic diseases, cancer, and aging. A key feature of autophagy is the de novo formation of autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicular structures encapsulating cytoplasmic cargo for vacuolar turnover and recycling. The membrane rearrangements underlying nucleation, expansion, closure, and vacuolar fusion of autophagosomes are driven by multicomponent core autophagy machinery in cooperation with numerous factors involved in a variety of cellular processes. Our current understanding of the origin and contribution of diverse membrane sources to autophagosome biogenesis and of cellular functions enabling stress-appropriate autophagy responses critical for cell health and survival remains limited. Here, we summarize and discuss our recent findings analyzing the role of lipid droplets (LDs), conserved intracellular storage compartments for neutral lipids, for autophagy regulation. Our data indicate that LDs are dispensable as membrane sources, but fulfill critical functions for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, including buffering of newly synthesized fatty acids and maintenance of phospholipid composition, required for intact autophagy regulation and cell survival during nutrient stress.

%X Lipid droplets (LDs) are conserved organelles for intracellular neutral lipid storage. Recent studies suggest that LDs function as direct lipid sources for autophagy, a central catabolic process in homeostasis and stress response. Here, we demonstrate that LDs are dispensable as a membrane source for autophagy, but fulfill critical functions for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis linked to autophagy regulation. In the absence of LDs, yeast cells display alterations in their phospholipid composition and fail to buffer de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis causing chronic stress and morphologic changes in the ER. These defects compromise regulation of autophagy, including formation of multiple aberrant Atg8 puncta and drastically impaired autophagosome biogenesis, leading to severe defects in nutrient stress survival. Importantly, metabolically corrected phospholipid composition and improved FA resistance of LD-deficient cells cure autophagy and cell survival. Together, our findings provide novel insight into the complex interrelation between LD-mediated lipid homeostasis and the regulation of autophagy potentially relevant for neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue occurs in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of lipodystrophy, but whether this dysfunction contributes to or is the result of these disorders is unknown. To investigate the physiological consequences of severe mitochondrial impairment in adipose tissue, we generated mice deficient in mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in adipocytes by using mice carrying adiponectin-Cre and TFAM floxed alleles. These adiponectin TFAM-knockout (adipo-TFAM-KO) mice had a 75-81% reduction in TFAM in the subcutaneous and intra-abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), causing decreased expression and enzymatic activity of proteins in complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC). This mitochondrial dysfunction led to adipocyte death and inflammation in WAT and a whitening of BAT. As a result, adipo-TFAM-KO mice were resistant to weight gain, but exhibited insulin resistance on both normal chow and high-fat diets. These lipodystrophic mice also developed hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, isolated mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue can lead a syndrome of lipodystrophy with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular complications.

%X Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue, but the role for adipose tissue mitochondria in the development of these disorders is currently unknown. To understand the impact of adipose tissue mitochondria on whole-body metabolism, we have generated a mouse model with disruption of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) specifically in fat. F-TFKO adipose tissue exhibit decreased mtDNA copy number, altered levels of proteins of the electron transport chain, and perturbed mitochondrial function with decreased complex I activity and greater oxygen consumption and uncoupling. As a result, F-TFKO mice exhibit higher energy expenditure and are protected from age- and diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis, despite a greater food intake. Thus, TFAM deletion in the adipose tissue increases mitochondrial oxidation that has positive metabolic effects, suggesting that regulation of adipose tissue mitochondria may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity.

%X Improved efforts are necessary to define the functional product of cancer mutations currently being revealed through large-scale sequencing efforts. Using genome-scale pooled shRNA screening technology, we mapped negative genetic interactions across a set of isogenic cancer cell lines and confirmed hundreds of these interactions in orthogonal co-culture competition assays to generate a high-confidence genetic interaction network of differentially essential or differential essentiality (DiE) genes. The network uncovered examples of conserved genetic interactions, densely connected functional modules derived from comparative genomics with model systems data, functions for uncharacterized genes in the human genome and targetable vulnerabilities. Finally, we demonstrate a general applicability of DiE gene signatures in determining genetic dependencies of other non-isogenic cancer cell lines. For example, the PTEN(-/-) DiE genes reveal a signature that can preferentially classify PTEN-dependent genotypes across a series of non-isogenic cell lines derived from the breast, pancreas and ovarian cancers. Our reference network suggests that many cancer vulnerabilities remain to be discovered through systematic derivation of a network of differentially essential genes in an isogenic cancer cell model.

%X The highly conserved Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrient availability. TOR functions in two structurally and functionally distinct complexes, TOR Complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR Complex 2 (TORC2). Through TORC1, TOR negatively regulates autophagy, a conserved process that functions in quality control and cellular homeostasis and, in this capacity, is part of an adaptive nutrient deprivation response. Here we demonstrate that during amino acid starvation TOR also operates independently as a positive regulator of autophagy through the conserved TORC2 and its downstream target protein kinase, Ypk1. Under these conditions, TORC2-Ypk1 signaling negatively regulates the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, to enable the activation of the amino acid-sensing eIF2alpha kinase, Gcn2, and to promote autophagy. Our work reveals that the TORC2 pathway regulates autophagy in an opposing manner to TORC1 to provide a tunable response to cellular metabolic status.

%X Normal brain function depends on the interaction between highly specialized neurons that operate within anatomically and functionally distinct brain regions. Neuronal specification is driven by transcriptional programs that are established during early neuronal development and remain in place in the adult brain. The fidelity of neuronal specification depends on the robustness of the transcriptional program that supports the neuron type-specific gene expression patterns. Here we show that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which supports neuron specification during differentiation, contributes to the suppression of a transcriptional program that is detrimental to adult neuron function and survival. We show that PRC2 deficiency in striatal neurons leads to the de-repression of selected, predominantly bivalent PRC2 target genes that are dominated by self-regulating transcription factors normally suppressed in these neurons. The transcriptional changes in PRC2-deficient neurons lead to progressive and fatal neurodegeneration in mice. Our results point to a key role of PRC2 in protecting neurons against degeneration.

%X The poly(adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein family generates ADP-ribose (ADPr) modifications onto target proteins using NAD(+) as substrate. Based on the composition of three NAD(+) coordinating amino acids, the H-Y-E motif, each PARP is predicted to generate either poly(ADPr) (PAR) or mono(ADPr) (MAR). However, the reaction product of each PARP has not been clearly defined, and is an important priority since PAR and MAR function via distinct mechanisms. Here we show that the majority of PARPs generate MAR, not PAR, and demonstrate that the H-Y-E motif is not the sole indicator of PARP activity. We identify automodification sites on seven PARPs, and demonstrate that MAR and PAR generating PARPs modify similar amino acids, suggesting that the sequence and structural constraints limiting PARPs to MAR synthesis do not limit their ability to modify canonical amino-acid targets. In addition, we identify cysteine as a novel amino-acid target for ADP-ribosylation on PARPs.

%X ATP dependent proteolytic degradation of misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix is mediated by the PIM1 protease and depends on the molecular chaperone proteins mt-hsp70 and Mdj1p. Chaperone function is essential to maintain misfolded proteins in a soluble state, a prerequisite for their degradation by PIM1 protease. In the absence of functional mt-hsp70 or Mdj1p misfolded proteins either remain associated with mt-hsp70 or form aggregates and thereby are no longer substrates for PIM1 protease. Mdj1p is shown to regulate the ATP dependent association of an unfolded polypeptide chain with mt-hsp70 affecting binding to as well as release from mt-hsp70. These findings establish a central role of molecular chaperone proteins in the degradation of misfolded proteins by PIM1 protease and thereby demonstrate a functional interrelation between components of the folding machinery and the proteolytic system within mitochondria.

%X The biogenesis of the ATP-dependent PIM1 protease of mitochondria was studied by mutational analysis. The ATPase and proteolytic activities of PIM1 were shown to be essential for mitochondrial function. A proteolytically inactive mutant form of PIM1 protease accumulated as a pro-form in mitochondria, revealing a two-step processing of PIM1: the matrix targeting signal is removed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase and then a pro-region of 61 amino acids is cleaved off in an autocatalytic reaction. This latter process depended on the ATP-dependent assembly of PIM1 protease subunits and can occur by an intermolecular and, most probably, also an intramolecular pathway. The respiratory competence of cells harboring mutant PIM1 protease lacking the pro-region was strongly impaired. Subcellular fractionation revealed a cytosolic localization of mutant PIM1 protease. This demonstrates the requirement for the propeptide for efficient sorting of PIM1 protease to mitochondria.

%X Mitochondrial morphology is shaped by fusion and division of their membranes. Here, we found that adult myocardial function depends on balanced mitochondrial fusion and fission, maintained by processing of the dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatase OPA1 by the mitochondrial peptidases YME1L and OMA1. Cardiac-specific ablation of Yme1l in mice activated OMA1 and accelerated OPA1 proteolysis, which triggered mitochondrial fragmentation and altered cardiac metabolism. This caused dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Cardiac function and mitochondrial morphology were rescued by Oma1 deletion, which prevented OPA1 cleavage. Feeding mice a high-fat diet or ablating Yme1l in skeletal muscle restored cardiac metabolism and preserved heart function without suppressing mitochondrial fragmentation. Thus, unprocessed OPA1 is sufficient to maintain heart function, OMA1 is a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte survival, and mitochondrial morphology and cardiac metabolism are intimately linked.

%X Mitochondrial morphology varies tremendously across cell types and tissues, changing rapidly in response to external insults and metabolic cues, such as nutrient status. The many functions of mitochondria have been intimately linked to their morphology, which is shaped by ongoing events of fusion and fission of outer and inner membranes (OM and IM). Unopposed fission causes mitochondrial fragmentation, which is generally associated with metabolic dysfunction and disease. Unopposed fusion results in a hyperfused network and serves to counteract metabolic insults, preserve cellular integrity, and protect against autophagy. Here, we review the ways in which metabolic alterations convey changes in mitochondrial morphology and how disruption of mitochondrial morphology impacts cellular and organismal metabolism.

%X The SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflC/K) superfamily is composed of scaffold proteins that form ring-like structures and locally specify the protein-lipid composition in a variety of cellular membranes. Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP2) is a member of this superfamily that localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) where it acts as a membrane organizer. Here, we report that SLP2 anchors a large protease complex composed of the rhomboid protease PARL and the i-AAA protease YME1L, which we term the SPY complex (for SLP2-PARL-YME1L). Association with SLP2 in the SPY complex regulates PARL-mediated processing of PTEN-induced kinase PINK1 and the phosphatase PGAM5 in mitochondria. Moreover, SLP2 inhibits the stress-activated peptidase OMA1, which can bind to SLP2 and cleaves PGAM5 in depolarized mitochondria. SLP2 restricts OMA1-mediated processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1 allowing stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion under starvation conditions. Together, our results reveal an important role of SLP2 membrane scaffolds for the spatial organization of IM proteases regulating mitochondrial dynamics, quality control, and cell survival.

%X Healthy placental development is essential for reproductive success; failure of the feto-maternal interface results in pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation. We found that grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), a CP2-type transcription factor, is highly expressed in chorionic trophoblast cells, including basal chorionic trophoblast (BCT) cells located at the chorioallantoic interface in murine placentas. Placentas from Grhl2-deficient mouse embryos displayed defects in BCT cell polarity and basement membrane integrity at the chorioallantoic interface, as well as a severe disruption of labyrinth branching morphogenesis. Selective Grhl2 inactivation only in epiblast-derived cells rescued all placental defects but phenocopied intraembryonic defects observed in global Grhl2 deficiency, implying the importance of Grhl2 activity in trophectoderm-derived cells. ChIP-seq identified 5282 GRHL2 binding sites in placental tissue. By integrating these data with placental gene expression profiles, we identified direct and indirect Grhl2 targets and found a marked enrichment of GRHL2 binding adjacent to genes downregulated in Grhl2(-/-) placentas, which encoded known regulators of placental development and epithelial morphogenesis. These genes included that encoding the serine protease inhibitor Kunitz type 1 (Spint1), which regulates BCT cell integrity and labyrinth formation. In human placenta, we found that human orthologs of murine GRHL2 and its targets displayed co-regulation and were expressed in trophoblast cells in a similar domain as in mouse placenta. Our data indicate that a conserved Grhl2-coordinated gene network controls trophoblast branching morphogenesis, thereby facilitating development of the site of feto-maternal exchange. This might have implications for syndromes related to placental dysfunction.

%X 1. Current opinions on the mechanisms for glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity are reviewed. The protective role of astrocytic high-affinity glutamate transport is also discussed. 2. Low-density seeding of primary astrocytes from rat hemispheres was found to result in the development of reactive-like astrocytes. Typical glial signs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) could not be induced in astrocyte cultures by serum from ALS-patients. 3. Glutamate (100 mumol/L) was found to induce an increase in respiratory activity in primary cultures of astrocytes. This stimulation appeared to be related to the co-transport of Na2+ with glutamate and a resulting activation of Na2+/K(+)-ATPase. Both basal respiration and glutamate-stimulated oxygen consumption was inhibited by organic solvents. 4. Preliminary results show that heavy metals cause an increase in the mitochondrial DNA content at concentrations that have no effect on growth rate or morphology in a glial cell line. This increase was accompanied by an inhibition of oxygen consumption and an increased production of lactate at unaltered ATP levels.

%X The RNA-binding protein LIN-28 was first found to control developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans. Later, it was found to play important roles in pluripotency, metabolism, and cancer in mammals. Here we report that a low dosage of lin-28 enhanced stress tolerance and longevity, and reduced germline stem/progenitor cell number in C. elegans. The germline LIN-28-regulated microRNA let-7 was required for these effects by targeting akt-1/2 and decreasing their protein levels. AKT-1/2 and the downstream DAF-16 transcription factor were both required for the lifespan and germline stem cell effects of lin-28. The pathway also mediated dietary restriction induced lifespan extension and reduction in germline stem cell number. Thus, the LIN-28/let-7/AKT/DAF-16 axis we delineated here is a program that plays an important role in balancing reproduction and somatic maintenance and their response to the environmental energy level-a central dogma of the 'evolutionary optimization' of resource allocation that modulates aging.

%X Skeletal muscle expresses high levels of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), predominantly at myotendinous junctions (MTJs) and costameres. ILK binds the cytoplasmic domain of beta1 integrin and mediates phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, which in turn plays a central role during skeletal muscle regeneration. We show that mice with a skeletal muscle-restricted deletion of ILK develop a mild progressive muscular dystrophy mainly restricted to the MTJs with detachment of basement membranes and accumulation of extracellular matrix. Endurance exercise training enhances the defects at MTJs, leads to disturbed subsarcolemmal myofiber architecture, and abrogates phosphorylation of Ser473 as well as phosphorylation of Thr308 of PKB/Akt. The reduction in PKB/Akt activation is accompanied by an impaired insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) activation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that the beta1 integrin subunit is associated with the IGF-1R in muscle cells. Our data identify the beta1 integrin-ILK complex as an important component of IGF-1R/insulin receptor substrate signaling to PKB/Akt during mechanical stress in skeletal muscle.

%X We have attempted to determine whether loss of mtDNA and respiratory chain function result in apoptosis in vivo. Apoptosis was studied in embryos with homozygous disruption of the mitochondrial transcription factor A gene (Tfam) and tissue-specific Tfam knockout animals with severe respiratory chain deficiency in the heart. We found massive apoptosis in Tfam knockout embryos at embryonic day (E) 9.5 and increased apoptosis in the heart of the tissue-specific Tfam knockouts. Furthermore, mtDNA-less (rho(0)) cell lines were susceptible to apoptosis induced by different stimuli in vitro. The data presented here provide in vivo evidence that respiratory chain deficiency predisposes cells to apoptosis, contrary to previous assumptions based on in vitro studies of cultured cells. These results suggest that increased apoptosis is a pathogenic event in human mtDNA mutation disorders. The finding that respiratory chain deficiency is associated with increased in vivo apoptosis may have important therapeutic implications for human disease. Respiratory chain deficiency and cell loss and/or apoptosis have been associated with neurodegeneration, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and aging. Furthermore, chemotherapy and radiation treatment of cancer are intended to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. It would therefore be of interest to determine whether manipulation of respiratory chain function can be used to inhibit or enhance apoptosis in these conditions.

%X Mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause several well-recognized human genetic syndromes with deficient oxidative phosphorylation and may also have a role in ageing and acquired diseases of old age. We report here that hallmarks of mtDNA mutation disorders can be reproduced in the mouse using a conditional mutation strategy to manipulate the expression of the gene encoding mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam, previously named mtTFA), which regulates transcription and replication of mtDNA. Using a loxP-flanked Tfam allele (TfamloxP) in combination with a cre-recombinase transgene under control of the muscle creatinine kinase promoter, we have disrupted Tfam in heart and muscle. Mutant animals develop a mosaic cardiac-specific progressive respiratory chain deficiency, dilated cardiomyopathy, atrioventricular heart conduction blocks and die at 2-4 weeks of age. This animal model reproduces biochemical, morphological and physiological features of the dilated cardiomyopathy of Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Furthermore, our findings provide genetic evidence that the respiratory chain is critical for normal heart function.

%X The m-AAA protease preserves proteostasis of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It ensures a functional respiratory chain, by controlling the turnover of respiratory complex subunits and allowing mitochondrial translation, but other functions in mitochondria are conceivable. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of the m-AAA protease have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases in humans, such as hereditary spastic paraplegia and spinocerebellar ataxia. While essential functions of the m-AAA protease for neuronal survival have been established, its role in adult glial cells remains enigmatic. Here, we show that deletion of the highly expressed subunit AFG3L2 in mature mouse oligodendrocytes provokes early-on mitochondrial fragmentation and swelling, as previously shown in neurons, but causes only late-onset motor defects and myelin abnormalities. In contrast, total ablation of the m-AAA protease, by deleting both Afg3l2 and its paralogue Afg3l1, triggers progressive motor dysfunction and demyelination, owing to rapid oligodendrocyte cell death. Surprisingly, the mice showed premature hair greying, caused by progressive loss of melanoblasts that share a common developmental origin with Schwann cells and are targeted in our experiments. Thus, while both neurons and glial cells are dependant on the m-AAA protease for survival in vivo, complete ablation of the complex is necessary to trigger death of oligodendrocytes, hinting to cell-autonomous thresholds of vulnerability to m-AAA protease deficiency.

%X The mechanisms of mitochondrial DNA replication have been hotly debated for a decade. The strand-displacement model states that lagging-strand DNA synthesis is initiated from the origin of light-strand DNA replication (OriL), whereas the strand-coupled model implies that OriL is dispensable. Mammalian mitochondria cannot be transfected and the requirements of OriL in vivo have therefore not been addressed. We here use in vivo saturation mutagenesis to demonstrate that OriL is essential for mtDNA maintenance in the mouse. Biochemical and bioinformatic analyses show that OriL is functionally conserved in vertebrates. Our findings strongly support the strand-displacement model for mtDNA replication.

%X Cell survival under severe thermal stress requires the activity of a bi-chaperone system, consisting of the ring-forming AAA+ chaperone ClpB (Hsp104) and the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone system, which acts to solubilize and reactivate aggregated proteins. Recent studies have provided novel insight into the mechanism of protein disaggregation, demonstrating that ClpB/Hsp104 extracts unfolded polypeptides from an aggregate by threading them through its central pore. This translocation activity is necessary but not sufficient for aggregate solubilization. In addition, the middle (M) domain of ClpB and the DnaK system have essential roles, possibly by providing an unfolding force, which facilitates the extraction of misfolded proteins from aggregates.

%X Cell survival under severe thermal stress requires the activity of the ClpB (Hsp104) AAA+ chaperone that solubilizes and reactivates aggregated proteins in concert with the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone system. How protein disaggregation is achieved and whether survival is solely dependent on ClpB-mediated elimination of aggregates or also on reactivation of aggregated proteins has been unclear. We engineered a ClpB variant, BAP, which associates with the ClpP peptidase and thereby is converted into a degrading disaggregase. BAP translocates substrates through its central pore directly into ClpP for degradation. ClpB-dependent translocation is demonstrated to be an integral part of the disaggregation mechanism. Protein disaggregation by the BAP/ClpP complex remains dependent on DnaK, defining a role for DnaK at early stages of the disaggregation reaction. The activity switch of BAP to a degrading disaggregase does not support thermotolerance development, demonstrating that cell survival during severe thermal stress requires reactivation of aggregated proteins.

%X An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative human lymphoid B-cell line, DG75, was stably transfected with recombinant selection vectors that carry a subfragment of the BamHI WYH region (nucleotides 44664 to 50628), the BamHI K fragment, or a subfragment of the EcoRI D region (nucleotides 166614 to 170149) of B95-8 EBV DNA. These fragments contain the coding exons for the EBV-determined nuclear antigens EBNA2 and EBNA1, and the membrane antigen LMP, respectively. Antigen expression of the cells was detected by immunofluorescence. EBNA2 was expressed in 80-100% of the transfected cells, in contrast to EBNA1 which was expressed in only 25%, and LMP in only about 5% of the cells. Humoral antibody responses were measured by immunofluorescence and compared to cellular immunity as determined by the leukocyte migration inhibition (LMI) technique. Extracts from transfected cell lines expressing EBNA1, EBNA2 or LMP elicited an LMI response with cells from healthy EBV-seropositive individuals whereas the extract from the parental DG75 cell line did not. The results demonstrate the value of stably transfected cell lines expressing a defined EBV antigen for the monospecific analysis of host responses to the EBV-encoded antigen complex in growth-transformed cells.

%X Endostatin, the COOH-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth. To understand the mechanisms behind endostatin action, we analyzed the plasma membrane- extracellular matrix interactions of recombinant human endostatin in cultured microvascular endothelial cells. We observed that endostatin induced rapid clustering of alpha5beta1 integrin associated with actin stress fibers and its concomitant colocalization with the membrane anchor protein caveolin-1. Furthermore, endostatin could be coimmunoprecipitated with alpha5beta1 and caveolin-1 from endothelial cell extracts. Endostatin treatment induced phosphatase-dependent activation of caveolin-associated Src family kinases. The disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by endostatin was found to occur via activation of Src and in a tyrosyl phosphatase-dependent manner. The endostatin-treated cells void of the focal adhesions had impaired ability to deposit fibronectin into their extracellular matrices and were unable to migrate in response to basic fibroblast growth factor in a wounding experiment. These results indicate that recombinant endostatin interacts with alpha5beta1 integrin and caveolin-1 at the endothelial cell surface. In addition, the antimigratory effect of endostatin involves phosphatase-dependent Src activation and impaired cell-matrix interactions.

%X Endostatin, the C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Observations that endostatin inhibits endothelial cell migration and induces disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton provide putative cellular mechanisms for this effect. To understand the mechanisms of endostatin-induced intracellular signaling, we analyzed the association of recombinant endostatin with endothelial cell lipid rafts and the roles of its heparin- and integrin-binding properties in this interaction. We observed that a fraction of cell surface-bound endostatin partitioned in low density membrane raft fractions together with caveolin-1. Heparinase treatment of cells prevented the recruitment of endostatin to the lipid rafts but did not affect the association of endostatin with the non-raft fraction, whereas preincubation of endostatin with soluble alpha5beta1 integrin prevented the association of endostatin with the endothelial cell membrane. Endostatin treatment induced recruitment of alpha5beta1 integrin into the raft fraction via a heparan sulfate proteoglycan-dependent mechanism. Subsequently, through alpha5beta1 integrin, heparan sulfate, and lipid raft-mediated interactions, endostatin induced Src-dependent activation of p190RhoGAP with concomitant decrease in RhoA activity and disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. These observations provide a cell biological mechanism, which plausibly explains the anti-angiogenic mechanisms of endostatin in vivo.

%X Membrane trafficking pathways function to sort and transport cargoes to various intracellular compartments and to the plasma membrane. This allows precise spatiotemporal control of processes such as signal transduction, which in turn is crucial for complex cell functions such as cell division, migration and polarity. Recent studies identified cell-matrix adhesions as regulators of exocytosis, endocytosis and the recycling machinery, thus establishing a new layer of crosstalk between cell adhesion and signaling. This review discusses these findings and considers their implications for signaling events downstream of integrins and growth factor receptors.

%X Caveolae are specialized compartments of the plasma membrane that are involved in signaling, endocytosis, and cholesterol transport. Their formation requires the transport of caveolin-1 to the plasma membrane, but the molecular mechanisms regulating the transport are largely unknown. Here, we identify a critical role for adhesion-mediated signaling through beta1 integrins and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in caveolae formation. Mice lacking beta1 integrins or ILK in keratinocytes have dramatically reduced numbers of plasma membrane caveolae in vivo, which is due to impaired transport of caveolin-1-containing vesicles along microtubules (MT) to the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, ILK promotes the recruitment of the F-actin binding protein IQGAP1 to the cell cortex, which, in turn, cooperates with its effector mDia1 to locally stabilize MTs and to allow stable insertion of caveolae into the plasma membrane. Our results assign an important role to the integrin/ILK complex for caveolar trafficking to the cell surface.

%X Dynamic interactions of cells with their environment regulate multiple aspects of tissue morphogenesis and function. Integrins are the major class of cell surface receptors that recognize and bind extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in the engagement and organization of the cytoskeleton as well as activation of signalling pathways to regulate cell behaviour and morphogenetic processes. The ternary complex of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), PINCH, and parvin (IPP complex), which was identified more than a decade ago, interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of beta integrins and couples them to the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, ILK has been shown to act as a serine/threonine kinase and to directly activate several signalling pathways downstream of integrins. However, the kinase activity of ILK and the precise functions of the IPP complex have remained elusive and controversial. This review focuses on the recent advances made towards understanding the specialized roles this complex and its individual components have acquired during evolution.

%X CYLD is a tumour-suppressor gene that is mutated in a benign skin tumour syndrome called cylindromatosis. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Here we show that CYLD controls cell growth and division at the G(1)/S-phase as well as cytokinesis by associating with alpha-tubulin and microtubules through its CAP-Gly domains. Translocation of activated CYLD to the perinuclear region of the cell is achieved by an inhibitory interaction of CYLD with histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) leading to an increase in the levels of acetylated alpha-tubulin around the nucleus. This facilitates the interaction of CYLD with Bcl-3, leading to a significant delay in the G(1)-to-S-phase transition. Finally, CYLD also interacts with HDAC6 in the midbody where it regulates the rate of cytokinesis in a deubiquitinase-independent manner. Altogether these results identify a mechanism by which CYLD regulates cell proliferation at distinct cell-cycle phases.

%X The development of multicellular organisms, as well as maintenance of organ architecture and function, requires robust regulation of cell fates. This is in part achieved by conserved signaling pathways through which cells process extracellular information and translate this information into changes in proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell shape. Gene deletion studies in higher eukaryotes have assigned critical roles for components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and their cellular receptors in a vast number of developmental processes, indicating that a large proportion of this signaling is regulated by cell-ECM interactions. In addition, genetic alterations in components of this signaling axis play causative roles in several human diseases. This review will discuss what genetic analyses in mice and lower organisms have taught us about adhesion signaling in development and disease.

%X Endostatin, a M(r) 20,000 fragment of collagen XVIII, is able to inhibit angiogenesis and induce apoptosis in endothelial cells in vivo. We analyzed the effectsof recombinant endostatin on human microvascular endothelial cells, focusing on pericellular plasminogen activation and its targeting by the focal adhesion-associated cytoskeletal structures. Analysis of the proteolytic plasminogen activator system revealed that endostatin modulates the distribution of soluble and cell surface-associated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 1 (PAI-1). Casein zymographic and immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that endostatin exerts its effects by decreasing the levels of soluble uPA and PAI-1 and their complexes in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence analysis of cell surface-associated uPA indicated that endostatin treatment caused the redistribution of receptor-bound uPA from focal contacts, resulting in diffuse cell surface staining. In accordance with this observation, immunofluorescence staining of the urokinase receptor revealed that endostatin treatment removed uPAR from focal adhesions. Accordingly, endostatin caused a rapid disassembly of focal adhesions as observed by immunofluorescence analysis of the focal adhesion proteins vinculin and paxillin. A prominent change in the cytoskeletal architecture was observed as the actin stress fiber network was dissociated in response to endostatin treatment. The effect of focal adhesion disassembly was reversible, persisting from 1 h up to 6 h. Our results suggest that the antiangiogenic activity of endostatin involves the modulation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers and the down-regulation of the urokinase plasminogen activator system.

%X BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Plaques are composed of the amyloid-beta peptide derived from cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mutations in APP lead to the development of Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD), however, the normal function of this protein has proven elusive. The organism Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model as the amyloid precursor-like protein (APL-1) is the single ortholog of APP, and loss of apl-1 leads to a severe molting defect and early larval lethality. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report here that lethality and molting can be rescued by full length APL-1, C-terminal mutations as well as a C-terminal truncation, suggesting that the extracellular region of the protein is essential for viability. RNAi knock-down of apl-1 followed by drug testing on the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb showed that loss of apl-1 leads to aldicarb hypersensitivity, indicating a defect in synaptic function. The aldicarb hypersensitivity can be rescued by full length APL-1 in a dose dependent fashion. At the cellular level, kinesins UNC-104/KIF-1A and UNC-116/kinesin-1 are positive regulators of APL-1 expression in the neurons. Knock-down of the small GTPase rab-5 also leads to a dramatic decrease in the amount of apl-1 expression in neurons, suggesting that trafficking from the plasma membrane to the early endosome is important for apl-1 function. Loss of function of a different small GTPase, UNC-108, on the contrary, leads to the retention of APL-1 in the cell body. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results reveal novel insights into the intracellular trafficking of APL-1 and we report a functional role for APL-1 in synaptic transmission.

%X BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid plaques composed primarily of the amyloid-beta peptide, a cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). While mutations in APP lead to the development of Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD), sporadic AD has only one clear genetic modifier: the epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene. Cholesterol starvation in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to molting and arrest phenotypes similar to loss-of-function mutants of the APP ortholog, apl-1 (amyloid precursor-like protein 1), and lrp-1 (lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1), suggesting a potential interaction between apl-1 and cholesterol metabolism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Previously, we found that RNAi knock-down of apl-1 leads to aldicarb hypersensitivity, indicating a defect in synaptic function. Here we find the same defect is recapitulated during lrp-1 knock-down and by cholesterol starvation. A cholesterol-free diet or loss of lrp-1 directly affects APL-1 levels as both lead to loss of APL-1::GFP fluorescence in neurons. However, loss of cholesterol does not affect global transcription or protein levels as seen by qPCR and Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that cholesterol and lrp-1 are involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission, similar to apl-1. Both are able to modulate APL-1 protein levels in neurons, however cholesterol changes do not affect global apl-1 transcription or APL-1 protein indicating the changes are specific to neurons. Thus, regulation of synaptic transmission and molting by LRP-1 and cholesterol may be mediated by their ability to control APL-1 neuronal protein expression.

%X Mating rate is a major determinant of female lifespan and fitness, and is predicted to optimize at an intermediate level, beyond which superfluous matings are costly. In female Drosophila melanogaster, nutrition is a key regulator of mating rate but the underlying mechanism is unknown. The evolutionarily conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor-like signalling (IIS) pathway is responsive to nutrition, and regulates development, metabolism, stress resistance, fecundity and lifespan. Here we show that inhibition of IIS, by ablation of Drosophila insulin-like peptide (DILP)-producing median neurosecretory cells, knockout of dilp2, dilp3 or dilp5 genes, expression of a dominant-negative DILP-receptor (InR) transgene or knockout of Lnk, results in reduced female remating rates. IIS-mediated regulation of female remating can occur independent of virgin receptivity, developmental defects, reduced body size or fecundity, and the receipt of the female receptivity-inhibiting male sex peptide. Our results provide a likely mechanism by which females match remating rates to the perceived nutritional environment. The findings suggest that longevity-mediating genes could often have pleiotropic effects on remating rate. However, overexpression of the IIS-regulated transcription factor dFOXO in the fat body-which extends lifespan-does not affect remating rate. Thus, long life and reduced remating are not obligatorily coupled.

%X The p.N478D missense mutation in human mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (mtPAP) has previously been implicated in a form of spastic ataxia with optic atrophy. In this study, we have investigated fibroblast cell lines established from family members. The homozygous mutation resulted in the loss of polyadenylation of all mitochondrial transcripts assessed; however, oligoadenylation was retained. Interestingly, this had differential effects on transcript stability that were dependent on the particular species of transcript. These changes were accompanied by a severe loss of oxidative phosphorylation complexes I and IV, and perturbation of de novo mitochondrial protein synthesis. Decreases in transcript polyadenylation and in respiratory chain complexes were effectively rescued by overexpression of wild-type mtPAP. Both mutated and wild-type mtPAP localized to the mitochondrial RNA-processing granules thereby eliminating mislocalization as a cause of defective polyadenylation. In vitro polyadenylation assays revealed severely compromised activity by the mutated protein, which generated only short oligo(A) extensions on RNA substrates, irrespective of RNA secondary structure. The addition of LRPPRC/SLIRP, a mitochondrial RNA-binding complex, enhanced activity of the wild-type mtPAP resulting in increased overall tail length. The LRPPRC/SLIRP effect although present was less marked with mutated mtPAP, independent of RNA secondary structure. We conclude that (i) the polymerase activity of mtPAP can be modulated by the presence of LRPPRC/SLIRP, (ii) N478D mtPAP mutation decreases polymerase activity and (iii) the alteration in poly(A) length is sufficient to cause dysregulation of post-transcriptional expression and the pathogenic lack of respiratory chain complexes.

%X Sterol metabolites are critical signaling molecules that regulate metabolism, development, and homeostasis. Oxysterols, bile acids (BAs), and steroids work primarily through cognate sterol-responsive nuclear hormone receptors to control these processes through feed-forward and feedback mechanisms. These signaling pathways are conserved from simple invertebrates to mammals. Indeed, results from various model organisms have yielded fundamental insights into cholesterol and BA homeostasis, lipid and glucose metabolism, protective mechanisms, tissue differentiation, development, reproduction, and even aging. Here, we review how sterols act through evolutionarily ancient mechanisms to control these processes.

%X Endogenous small molecule metabolites that regulate animal longevity are emerging as a novel means to influence health and life span. In C. elegans, bile acid-like steroids called the dafachronic acids (DAs) regulate developmental timing and longevity through the conserved nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12, a homolog of mammalian sterol-regulated receptors LXR and FXR. Using metabolic genetics, mass spectrometry, and biochemical approaches, we identify new activities in DA biosynthesis and characterize an evolutionarily conserved short chain dehydrogenase, DHS-16, as a novel 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Through regulation of DA production, DHS-16 controls DAF-12 activity governing longevity in response to signals from the gonad. Our elucidation of C. elegans bile acid biosynthetic pathways reveals the possibility of novel ligands as well as striking biochemical conservation to other animals, which could illuminate new targets for manipulating longevity in metazoans.

%X Bile acids are cholesterol-derived signaling molecules that regulate mammalian metabolism through sterol-sensing nuclear receptor transcription factors. In C. elegans, bile acid-like steroids called dafachronic acids (DAs) control developmental timing and longevity by activating the nuclear receptor DAF-12. However, little is known about the biosynthesis of these molecules. Here, we show that the DAF-36/Rieske oxygenase works at the first committed step, converting cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Its elucidation as a cholesterol 7-desaturase provides crucial biochemical evidence that such oxygenases are key steroidogenic enzymes. By controlling DA production, DAF-36 regulates DAF-12 activities for reproductive development and longevity and may illuminate related pathways in metazoans.

%X Measurement of food intake in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is often necessary for studies of behaviour, nutrition and drug administration. There is no reliable and agreed method for measuring food intake of flies in undisturbed, steady state, and normal culture conditions. We report such a method, based on measurement of feeding frequency by proboscis-extension, validated by short-term measurements of food dye intake. We used the method to demonstrate that (a) female flies feed more frequently than males, (b) flies feed more often when housed in larger groups and (c) fly feeding varies at different times of the day. We also show that alterations in food intake are not induced by dietary restriction or by a null mutation of the fly insulin receptor substrate chico. In contrast, mutation of takeout increases food intake by increasing feeding frequency while mutation of ovo(D) increases food intake by increasing the volume of food consumed per proboscis-extension. This approach provides a practical and reliable method for quantification of food intake in Drosophila under normal, undisturbed culture conditions.

%X Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified 697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated approximately 2,000, approximately 3,700 and approximately 9,500 SNPs explained approximately 21%, approximately 24% and approximately 29% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/beta-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of causal variants.

%X Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is a characteristic feature of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). Several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity in skeletal muscle is a primary defect causing insulin resistance and subsequent development of DM2. We have now experimentally tested this hypothesis by characterizing glucose homeostasis in tissue-specific knockout mice with progressive respiratory chain dysfunction selectively in skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, these knockout mice are not diabetic and have an increased peripheral glucose disposal when subjected to a glucose tolerance test. Studies of isolated skeletal muscle from knockout animals show an increased basal glucose uptake and a normal increase of glucose uptake in response to insulin. In summary, our findings indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle is not a primary etiological event in DM2.

%X Regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expression is critical for the control of oxidative phosphorylation in response to physiological demand, and this regulation is often impaired in disease and aging. We have previously shown that mitochondrial transcription termination factor 3 (MTERF3) is a key regulator that represses mtDNA transcription in the mouse, but its molecular mode of action has remained elusive. Based on the hypothesis that key regulatory mechanisms for mtDNA expression are conserved in metazoans, we analyzed Mterf3 knockout and knockdown flies. We demonstrate here that decreased expression of MTERF3 not only leads to activation of mtDNA transcription, but also impairs assembly of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. This novel function of MTERF3 in mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis is conserved in the mouse, thus we identify a novel and unexpected role for MTERF3 in coordinating the crosstalk between transcription and translation for the regulation of mammalian mtDNA gene expression.

%X We have generated an animal model for mitochondrial myopathy by disrupting the gene for mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in skeletal muscle of the mouse. The knockout animals developed a myopathy with ragged-red muscle fibers, accumulation of abnormally appearing mitochondria, and progressively deteriorating respiratory chain function in skeletal muscle. Enzyme histochemistry, electron micrographs, and citrate synthase activity revealed a substantial increase in mitochondrial mass in skeletal muscle of the myopathy mice. Biochemical assays demonstrated that the increased mitochondrial mass partly compensated for the reduced function of the respiratory chain by maintaining overall ATP production in skeletal muscle. The increased mitochondrial mass thus was induced by the respiratory chain deficiency and may be beneficial by improving the energy homeostasis in the affected tissue. Surprisingly, in vitro experiments to assess muscle function demonstrated that fatigue development did not occur more rapidly in myopathy mice, suggesting that overall ATP production is sufficient. However, there were lower absolute muscle forces in the myopathy mice, especially at low stimulation frequencies. This reduction in muscle force is likely caused by deficient formation of force-generating actin-myosin cross bridges and/or disregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Thus, both biochemical measurements of ATP-production rate and in vitro physiological studies suggest that reduced mitochondrial ATP production might not be as critical for the pathophysiology of mitochondrial myopathy as thought previously.

%X With ever-increasing elder population, the high incidence of age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders has turned out to be a huge public concern. Especially the elders and their families dreadfully suffer from the learning, behavioral and cognitive impairments. The lack of effective therapies for such a horrible symptom makes a great demanding for biological mechanism study for cognitive aging. Epigenetics is an emerging field that broadens the dimensions of mammalian genome blueprint. It is, unlike genetics, not only inheritable but also reversible. Recent studies suggest that DNA methylation, one of major epigenetic mechanisms, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerations and cognitive defects. In this review, the evolving knowledge of age-related cognitive functions and the potential DNA methylation mechanism of cognitive aging are discussed. That indicates the impairment of DNA methylation may be a crucial but reversible mechanism of behavioral and cognitive related neurodegeneration. The methods to examine the dynamics of DNA methylation patterns at tissue and single cell level and at the representative scale as well as the whole genome single base resolution are also briefly discussed. Importantly, the challenges of DNA methylation mechanism of cognitive aging research are brought up, and the possible solutions to tackle these difficulties are put forward.

%X Because the olfactory system plays a major role in food consumption, and because 'food addiction' and associated morbidities have reached epidemic proportions, we tested the hypothesis that dietary energy restriction can modify adverse effects of cocaine on behavior and olfactory cellular and molecular plasticity. Mice maintained on an alternate day fasting (ADF) diet exhibited increased baseline locomotion and increased cocaine-sensitized locomotion during cocaine conditioning, despite no change in cocaine conditioned place preference, compared with mice fed ad libitum. Levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the olfactory bulb (OB) were suppressed in mice on the ADF diet compared with mice on the control diet, independent of acute or chronic cocaine treatment. The expression of several enzymes involved in dopamine metabolism including tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine oxidases A and B, and catechol-O-methyltransferase were significantly reduced in OBs of mice on the ADF diet. Both acute and chronic administration of cocaine suppressed the production of new OB cells, and this effect of cocaine was attenuated in mice on the ADF diet. Cocaine administration to mice on the control diet resulted in up-regulation of OB genes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, cellular stress responses, and calcium- and cAMP-mediated signaling, whereas multiple olfactory receptor genes were down-regulated by cocaine treatment. ADF abolished many of the effects of cocaine on OB gene expression. Our findings reveal that dietary energy intake modifies the neural substrates underlying some of the behavioral and physiological responses to repeated cocaine treatment, and also suggest novel roles for the olfactory system in addiction. The data further suggest that modification of dietary energy intake could provide a novel potential approach to addiction treatments.

%X BACKGROUND: The structural and functional complexity of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is organized and modified by complicated molecular signaling processes that are poorly understood. RESULTS: We measured transcripts of 16,896 genes in 5 CNS regions from cohorts of young, middle-aged and old male and female mice that had been maintained on either a control diet or a low energy diet known to retard aging. Each CNS region (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum and spinal cord) possessed its own unique transcriptome fingerprint that was independent of age, gender and energy intake. Less than 10% of genes were significantly affected by age, diet or gender, with most of these changes occurring between middle and old age. The transcriptome of the spinal cord was the most responsive to age, diet and gender, while the striatal transcriptome was the least responsive. Gender and energy restriction had particularly robust influences on the hippocampal transcriptome of middle-aged mice. Prominent functional groups of age- and energy-sensitive genes were those encoding proteins involved in DNA damage responses (Werner and telomere-associated proteins), mitochondrial and proteasome functions, cell fate determination (Wnt and Notch signaling) and synaptic vesicle trafficking. CONCLUSION: Mouse CNS transcriptomes responded to age, energy intake and gender in a regionally distinctive manner. The systematic transcriptome dataset also provides a window into mechanisms of age-, diet- and sex-related CNS plasticity and vulnerability.

%X Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. In this work, we report on a comprehensive characterization of gene expression profiles of hepatitis B virus-positive HCC through the generation of a large set of 5'-read expressed sequence tag (EST) clusters (11,065 in total) from HCC and noncancerous liver samples, which then were applied to a cDNA microarray system containing 12,393 genes/ESTs and to comparison with a public database. The commercial cDNA microarray, which contains 1,176 known genes related to oncogenesis, was used also for profiling gene expression. Integrated data from the above approaches identified 2,253 genes/ESTs as candidates with differential expression. A number of genes related to oncogenesis and hepatic function/differentiation were selected for further semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis in 29 paired HCC/noncancerous liver samples. Many genes involved in cell cycle regulation such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and cell cycle negative regulators were deregulated in most patients with HCC. Aberrant expression of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway and enzymes for DNA replication also could contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC. The alteration of transcription levels was noted in a large number of genes implicated in metabolism, whereas a profile change of others might represent a status of dedifferentiation of the malignant hepatocytes, both considered as potential markers of diagnostic value. Notably, the altered transcriptome profiles in HCC could be correlated to a number of chromosome regions with amplification or loss of heterozygosity, providing one of the underlying causes of the transcription anomaly of HCC.

%X ATP-binding cassette (ABC) adenosine triphosphatases actively transport a wide variety of compounds across biological membranes. Here, the ABC protein Mdl1 was identified as an intracellular peptide transporter localized in the inner membrane of yeast mitochondria. Mdl1 was required for mitochondrial export of peptides with molecular masses of approximately 2100 to 600 daltons generated by proteolysis of inner-membrane proteins by the m-AAA protease in the mitochondrial matrix. Proteolysis by the i-AAA protease in the intermembrane space led to the release of similar-sized peptides independent of Mdl1. Thus, two pathways of peptide efflux from mitochondria exist that may allow communication between mitochondria and their cellular environment.

%X We present the AGEMAP (Atlas of Gene Expression in Mouse Aging Project) gene expression database, which is a resource that catalogs changes in gene expression as a function of age in mice. The AGEMAP database includes expression changes for 8,932 genes in 16 tissues as a function of age. We found great heterogeneity in the amount of transcriptional changes with age in different tissues. Some tissues displayed large transcriptional differences in old mice, suggesting that these tissues may contribute strongly to organismal decline. Other tissues showed few or no changes in expression with age, indicating strong levels of homeostasis throughout life. Based on the pattern of age-related transcriptional changes, we found that tissues could be classified into one of three aging processes: (1) a pattern common to neural tissues, (2) a pattern for vascular tissues, and (3) a pattern for steroid-responsive tissues. We observed that different tissues age in a coordinated fashion in individual mice, such that certain mice exhibit rapid aging, whereas others exhibit slow aging for multiple tissues. Finally, we compared the transcriptional profiles for aging in mice to those from humans, flies, and worms. We found that genes involved in the electron transport chain show common age regulation in all four species, indicating that these genes may be exceptionally good markers of aging. However, we saw no overall correlation of age regulation between mice and humans, suggesting that aging processes in mice and humans may be fundamentally different.

%X Kinases play a prominent role in tumor development, pointing to the presence of specific phosphorylation patterns in tumor tissues. Here, we investigate whether recently developed high resolution mass spectrometric (MS) methods for proteome and phosphoproteome analysis can also be applied to solid tumors. As tumor model, we used TG3 mutant mice carrying skin melanomas. At total of 100 microg of solid tumor lysate yielded a melanoma proteome of 4443 identified proteins, including at least 88 putative melanoma markers previously found by cDNA microarray technology. Analysis of 2 mg of lysate from dissected melanoma with titansphere chromatography and 8 mg with strong cation exchange together resulted in the identification of more than 5600 phosphorylation sites on 2250 proteins. The phosphoproteome included many hits from pathways important in melanoma. One-month storage at -80 degrees C did not significantly decrease the number of identified phosphorylation sites. Thus, solid tumor can be analyzed by MS-based proteomics with similar efficiency as cell culture models and in amounts compatible with biopsies.

%X Cancer progresses through distinct stages, and mouse models recapitulating traits of this progression are frequently used to explore genetic, morphological, and pharmacological aspects of tumor development. To complement genomic investigations of this process, we here quantify phosphoproteomic changes in skin cancer development using the SILAC mouse technology coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. We distill protein expression signatures from our data that distinguish between skin cancer stages. A distinct phosphoproteome of the two stages of cancer progression is identified that correlates with perturbed cell growth and implicates cell adhesion as a major driver of malignancy. Importantly, integrated analysis of phosphoproteomic data and prediction of kinase activity revealed PAK4-PKC/SRC network to be highly deregulated in SCC but not in papilloma. This detailed molecular picture, both at the proteome and phosphoproteome level, will prove useful for the study of mechanisms of tumor progression.

%X We have examined the gene structure and regulatory regions of octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4 (Oct 3/4), sex determining region Y box 2 (Sox2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), embryonal stem cell-specific gene 1 (ESG), Nanog homeobox (Nanog), and several other genes highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells across different species. Our analysis showed that ES cell-expressed Ras (ERAS) was orthologous to a human pseudogene Harvey Ras (HRASP) and that the promoter and other regulatory sequences were highly divergent. No ortholog of (ES) cell-derived homeobox containing gene (Ehox) could be identified in human, and the closest paralogs PEPP gene subfamily 1 (PEPP1), PEPP2, and extraembryonic, spermatogenesis, homeobox 1 (Esx1) were not expressed by ES cells and shared little homology. The Sox2 promoter was the most conserved across species and the Oct3/4 promoter region showed significant homology particularly in the distal enhancer active in ES cells. Analysis suggested common and divergent pathways of regulation. Conserved Oct3/4 and Sox2 co-binding domains were identified in most ES expressed genes, highlighting the importance of this transcriptional pathway. Conserved fibroblast growth factor response element sites were identified in regulatory regions, suggesting a potential parallel pathway for regulation by FGFs. A central role of Stat3 activation in self-renewal and in a regulatory feedback loop was suggested by the identification of the conserved binding sites in most pathways. Although most pathways were evolutionarily conserved, promoters and genomic structure of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) pathway components were divergent, likely explaining the differential requirement of LIF for human and rodent cells. Our analysis further suggested that the Nanog regulatory pathway was relatively independent of the LIF/Oct pathway and may interact with the Nodal/transforming growth factor-beta pathway. These results provide a framework for examining the current reported differences between rodent and human ES cells and define targets for future perturbation studies.

%X We investigated the effects of Matrine on proliferation by trypan blue exclusion and differentiation by benzidine staining positive cells in K-562 cells, assayed the telomerase activity using PCR-ELISA assay, analyzed cell cycle by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of the DNA content, and also determined the gene expression level of c-myc, N-ras and p53 by northern blot and dot blot analysis. The results showed that with the addition of 0.1 mg/ml Matrine, cell growth was inhibited significantly by 4 days, benizidine-positive cells rose from 1% to 2% in control cells to 15% in treated cells on day 5; treatment of K-562 cells with 0.1 mg/ml Matrine for 5 days resulted in a marked inhibition in telomerase activity, in a manner that correlated with the extent of differentiation; after exposure to Matrine for 72 h, 64.6% cells were arrested in the G1-phase of the cell cycle, the fraction of cells in S-phase had decreased from 56.9% in control cells to 24.4% in differentiated cells, and the levels of N-ras and p53 mRNA were remarkably increased for 24 and 48 h, respectively, c-myc mRNA expression level declined for 24 h and was inhibited significantly for 48 h. Our study confirmed that Matrine plays a significant effect on the inhibition of proliferation cells and inducing differentiation in K-562 cells.

%X Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that consist of tandem repeats of the DNA sequence TTAGGG and several proteins that protect the DNA and regulate the plasticity of the telomeres. The telomere-associated protein TRF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2) is critical for the control of telomere structure and function; TRF2 dysfunction results in the exposure of the telomere ends and activation of ATM (ataxia telangiectasin mutated)-mediated DNA damage response. Recent findings suggest that telomere attrition can cause senescence or apoptosis of mitotic cells, but the function of telomeres in differentiated neurons is unknown. Here, we examined the impact of telomere dysfunction via TRF2 inhibition in neurons (primary embryonic hippocampal neurons) and mitotic neural cells (astrocytes and neuroblastoma cells). We demonstrate that telomere dysfunction induced by adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant-negative TRF2 (DN-TRF2) triggers a DNA damage response involving the formation of nuclear foci containing phosphorylated histone H2AX and activated ATM in each cell type. In mitotic neural cells DN-TRF2 induced activation of both p53 and p21 and senescence (as indicated by an up-regulation of beta-galactosidase). In contrast, in neurons DN-TRF2 increased p21, but neither p53 nor beta-galactosidase was induced. In addition, TRF2 inhibition enhanced the morphological, molecular and biophysical differentiation of hippocampal neurons. These findings demonstrate divergent molecular and physiological responses to telomere dysfunction in mitotic neural cells and neurons, indicate a role for TRF2 in regulating neuronal differentiation, and suggest a potential therapeutic application of inhibition of TRF2 function in the treatment of neural tumors.

%X The ten-eleven translocation family of proteins (Tet1/2/3, Tets) converts 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which can be further oxidized and repaired by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), to influence gene transcription in embryonic and adult tissues. However the mechanisms of how Tets and TDG levels are regulated are unknown. We show that miR-29 can directly regulate Tet1-3 and TDG mRNA levels through binding to their 3'UTRs. miR-29 mimic decreases global 5hmC levels, a hallmark of Tet activity. Moreover, the mRNA levels for Tet3 and TDG are inversely correlated with the levels of miR-29 in aged mouse aorta implying that aging may affect methylation patterns via miRNA. In summary, our data show that Tets and TDG are direct targets of miR-29 and unravel a novel regulatory role for this miRNA in epigenetic DNA demethylation pathways.

%X Endostatin, the 20-kDa C-terminal NC1 domain of collagen XVIII, is an endogenous inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. A major problem in reconciling the many reported in vitro effects of endostatin is the lack of a high-affinity receptor, and a search for the latter continues. In accordance with the above, the molecular mechanisms of action of endostatin remain elusive. We show here that endostatin binds to membranes containing acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylglycerol (PG). More specifically, a red shift in the fluorescence emission of Trp of endostatin in the presence of liposomes containing these anionic lipids was evident, revealing the average environment of Trps to become less hydrophobic. This shift was not observed for phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes, demonstrating the acidic lipid to be required. Quenching by endostatin of the fluorescence of a pyrene-labeled phospholipid analogue in PS containing membranes was seen, while there was no effect for PC liposomes. Resonance energy transfer from the Trp residues of endostatin to a dansyl-labeled phospholipid further confirmed the association of endostatin with PS-containing membranes, whereas there was no binding to PC liposomes. Intriguingly, the association of endostatin with PS-containing liposomes triggered the formation of fibers, with Congo red staining producing green birefringence characteristic for amyloid. Lipid was incorporated into these fibers, as shown by staining when a trace amount (X = 0.02) of fluorescent phospholipid analogues was present in the liposomes. No fiber formation was seen when endostatin was added to liposomes composed of PC only. Because PS has been reported to be exposed in the outer surface of the plasma membrane of cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells, our results suggest that this lipid could represent a target for endostatin in the cancer cell surface and tumors, thus suggesting a novel mechanism of its action. More specifically, analogous to a number of other cytotoxic proteins interacting with negatively charged lipids, PS-triggered fiber formation by endostatin on the surface of cancer cells would impair the permeability barrier function of the plasma membrane, resulting in cell death.

%X Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers of mammalian cells. They are composed of a centriole pair and surrounding microtubule-nucleating material termed pericentriolar material (PCM). Bipolar mitotic spindle assembly relies on two intertwined processes: centriole duplication and centrosome maturation. In the first process, the single interphase centrosome duplicates in a tightly regulated manner so that two centrosomes are present in mitosis. In the second process, the two centrosomes increase in size and microtubule nucleation capacity through PCM recruitment, a process referred to as centrosome maturation. Failure to properly orchestrate centrosome duplication and maturation is inevitably linked to spindle defects, which can result in aneuploidy and promote cancer progression. It has been proposed that centriole assembly during duplication relies on both PCM and centriole proteins, raising the possibility that centriole duplication depends on PCM recruitment. In support of this model, C. elegans SPD-2 and mammalian NEDD-1 (GCP-WD) are key regulators of both these processes. SPD-2 protein sequence homologs have been identified in flies, mice, and humans, but their roles in centrosome biogenesis until now have remained unclear. Here, we show that Cep192, the human homolog of C. elegans and D. melanogaster SPD-2, is a major regulator of PCM recruitment, centrosome maturation, and centriole duplication in mammalian cells. We propose a model in which Cep192 and Pericentrin are mutually dependent for their localization to mitotic centrosomes during centrosome maturation. Both proteins are then required for NEDD-1 recruitment and the subsequent assembly of gamma-TuRCs and other factors into fully functional centrosomes.

%X Deficient enzymatic activity of the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside kinases deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) or thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) cause mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depletion syndromes in humans. Here we report the generation of a Tk2-deficient mouse strain and show that the mice develop essentially normally for the first week but from then on exhibit growth retardation and die within 2-4 weeks of life. Several organs including skeletal muscle, heart, liver and spleen showed progressive loss of mtDNA without increased mtDNA mutations or structural alterations. There were no major histological changes in skeletal muscle, but heart muscle showed disorganized and damaged muscle fibers. Electron microscopy showed mitochondria with distorted cristae. The Tk2-deficient mice exhibited pronounced hypothermia and showed loss of hypodermal fat and abnormal brown adipose tissue. We conclude that Tk2 has a major role in supplying deoxyribonucleotides for mtDNA replication and that other pathways of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis cannot compensate for loss of this enzyme.

%X Ageing, a leading cause of the decline/deficits in human learning, memory, and cognitive abilities, is a major risk factor for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetics, an inheritable but reversible biochemical process, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of age-related neurological disorders. DNA methylation, the best-known epigenetic mark, has attracted most attention in this regard. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are key enzymes in mediating the DNA methylation process, by which a methyl group is transferred, faithfully or anew, to genomic DNA sequences. Biologically, DNMTs are important for gene imprinting. Accumulating evidence suggests that DNMTs not only play critical roles, including gene imprinting and transcription regulation, in early development stages of the central nervous system (CNS), but also are indispensable in adult learning, memory, and cognition. Therefore, the impact of DNMTs and DNA methylation on age-associated cognitive functions and neurodegenerative diseases has emerged as a pivotal topic in the field. In this review, the effects of each DNMT on CNS development and healthy and pathological ageing are discussed.

%X Biological patterns emerge through specialization of genetically identical cells to take up distinct fates according to their position within the organism. How initial symmetry is broken to give rise to these patterns remains an intriguing open question. Several theories of patterning have been proposed, most prominently Turing's reaction-diffusion model of a slowly diffusing activator and a fast diffusing inhibitor generating periodic patterns. Although these reaction-diffusion systems can generate diverse patterns, it is becoming increasingly evident that cell shape and tension anisotropies, mediated via cell-cell and/or cell-matrix contacts, also facilitate symmetry breaking and subsequent self-organized tissue patterning. This review will highlight recent studies that implicate local changes in adhesion and/or tension as key drivers of cell rearrangements. We will also discuss recent studies on the role of cadherin and integrin adhesive receptors in mediating and responding to local tissue tension asymmetries to coordinate cell fate, position and behavior essential for tissue self-organization and maintenance.

%X Stem cells have the ability to self-renew and differentiate along multiple lineages, driving tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Paradigms of unidirectional, hierarchical differentiation trajectories observed in embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells have traditionally been applied to tissue-resident stem cells. However, accumulating evidence implicates stemness as a bidirectional, dynamic state that is largely governed by the niche, which facilitates plasticity and adaptability to changing conditions. In this Review, we discuss mechanisms of cell fate regulation through niche-derived cues, with a particular focus on epithelial stem cells of the mammalian skin, intestine and lung. We discuss a spectrum of niche-derived biochemical, mechanical and architectural inputs that define stem cell states during morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration, and highlight how these diverse inputs influence stem cell plasticity.

%X Increasing life expectancy is causing the prevalence of age-related diseases to rise, and there is an urgent need for new strategies to improve health at older ages. Reduced activity of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) nutrient-sensing signaling network can extend lifespan and improve health during aging in diverse organisms. However, the extensive feedback in this network and adverse side-effects of inhibition imply that simultaneous targeting of specific effectors in the network may most effectively combat the effects of aging. We show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor rapamycin, and the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor lithium act additively to increase longevity in Drosophila. Remarkably, the triple drug combination increased lifespan by 48%. Furthermore, the combination of lithium with rapamycin cancelled the latter’s effects on lipid metabolism. In conclusion, a polypharmacology approach of combining established, prolongevity drug inhibitors of specific nodes may be the most effective way to target the nutrient-sensing network to improve late-life health.

%X Leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation disorder (LBSL) arises from mutations in mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (DARS2) gene. The disease has a childhood or juvenile-onset and is clinically characterized by cerebellar ataxia, cognitive decline and distinct morphological abnormalities upon magnetic resonance imaging. We previously demonstrated that neurons and not adult myelin-producing cells are specifically sensitive to DARS2 loss, hence likely the primary culprit in LBSL disorder. We used conditional Purkinje cell (PCs)-specific Dars2 deletion to elucidate further the cell-type-specific contribution of this class of neurons to the cerebellar impairment observed in LBSL. We show that DARS2 depletion causes a severe mitochondrial dysfunction concomitant with a massive loss of PCs by the age of 15 weeks, thereby rapidly deteriorating motor skills. Our findings conclusively show that DARS2 is indispensable for PC survival and highlights the central role of neuroinflammation in DARS2-related PC degeneration.

%X Functional genomic screening with CRISPR has provided a powerful and precise new way to interrogate the phenotypic consequences of gene manipulation in high-throughput, unbiased analyses. However, some experimental paradigms prove especially challenging and require carefully and appropriately adapted screening approaches. In particular, negative selection (or sensitivity) screening, often the most experimentally desirable modality of screening, has remained a challenge in drug discovery. Here we assess whether our new, modular genome-wide pooled CRISPR library can improve negative selection CRISPR screening and add utility throughout the drug development pipeline. Our pooled library is split into three parts, allowing it to be scaled to accommodate the experimental challenges encountered during drug development, such as target identification using unlimited cell numbers compared with target identification studies for cell populations where cell numbers are limiting. To test our new library, we chose to look for drug-gene interactions using a well-described small molecule inhibitor targeting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and in particular to identify genes which sensitise cells to this drug. We simulate hit identification and performance using each library partition and support these findings through orthogonal drug combination cell panel screening. We also compare our data with a recently published CRISPR sensitivity dataset obtained using the same PARP1 inhibitor. Overall, our data indicate that generating a comprehensive CRISPR knockout screening library where the number of guides can be scaled to suit the biological question being addressed allows a library to have multiple uses throughout the drug development pipeline, and that initial validation of hits can be achieved through high-throughput cell panels screens where clinical grade chemical or biological matter exist.

%X BACKGROUND: The positive effect of systematic lymphadenectomy on survival of patients with endometrial cancer is a topic of ongoing debate. METHODS: We aimed to investigate whether systemic lymphadenectomy is beneficial for patients with early endometrial cancer. For this purpose, we analyzed a population-based registry with of 2392 women with endometrioid endometrial cancer, stage I and II at intermediate and high risk of recurrence. The primary outcome measure was overall survival. RESULTS: After exclusions, 868 women were eligible for analysis. Of those, 511 and 357 were categorized as intermediate (pT1A G3 and pT1B G1-2) and high risk (pT1B G3 and pT2 G1-3) early stage endometrial cancer, respectively. Lymphadenectomy was performed in 527 (60.7%) of the cases. Patients in the lymphadenectomy group were significantly younger, presented with more tumors of intermediate or undifferentiated grade and exhibited significantly lower co-morbidity rates and Eastern Cooperative of Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Median follow-up was 6.7 years. Recurrence-free survival was not improved by lymphadenectomy in the intermediate and high-risk group of patients. During the follow-up period, 111 (12.8%) women had disease recurrence and 302 (34.8%) died. Systematic lymphadenectomy was associated with significant improvement of overall survival in the pT1A G3 and pT1B G3 patient subgroups. Notably, adjustment for patient age and ECOG status abolished the improvement of overall survival by systematic lymphadenectomy in all groups. Thus, lymphadenectomy did not improve recurrence-free survival in the intermediate risk or the high-risk group of patients CONCLUSIONS: Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy did not improve the survival of patients with early stage I and II endometrioid endometrial cancer at intermediate and high risk of recurrence.

%X INTRODUCTION: The risk of contralateral lymph node metastases following unilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases in patients with vulvar cancer(s) remains to be systematically assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter, retrospective registry-based study of 476 patients with vulvar cancer. The primary outcome measure was the rate of contralateral non-SLN metastases in the case of positive unilateral SLN. RESULTS: Out of 476 patients with primary vulvar cancer, 202 received SLN biopsy: 58 unilateral and 144 bilateral. Out of 66 patients with unilateral metastatic SLN, 62 (93.9%) received contralateral lymphadenectomy-18 after unilateral and 44 after bilateral SLN biopsy. In the study group, 132 SLN were assessed with a median number of 2 (range 1-4) per patient and 76 of these were positive. Lymph node-positivity was associated with advanced tumor stage, as well as lymph and vascular space invasion. In the group of patients with bilateral inguino-femoral lymphadenectomy, 1004 lymph nodes were resected with a median number of 15 (range 10-29) per patient. After full dissection of the inguino-femoral lymph nodes, no contralateral non-SLN metastases were found. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of contralateral non-SLN metastases in patients with unilateral SLN metastases was low. Therefore, the impact of contralateral lymphadenectomy on patient survival should be investigated in further studies.

%X Lowered insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS) can extend healthy lifespan in worms, flies, and mice, but it can also have adverse effects (the "insulin paradox"). Chronic, moderately lowered IIS rescues age-related decline in neurotransmission through the Drosophila giant fiber system (GFS), a simple escape response neuronal circuit, by increasing targeting of the gap junctional protein innexin shaking-B to gap junctions (GJs). Endosomal recycling of GJs was also stimulated in cultured human cells when IIS was reduced. Furthermore, increasing the activity of the recycling small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) Rab4 or Rab11 was sufficient to maintain GJs upon elevated IIS in cultured human cells and in flies, and to rescue age-related loss of GJs and of GFS function. Lowered IIS thus elevates endosomal recycling of GJs in neurons and other cell types, pointing to a cellular mechanism for therapeutic intervention into aging-related neuronal disorders.

%X Growth factors of the TGF-beta superfamily play key roles in regulating neuronal and muscle function. Myostatin (or GDF8) and GDF11 are potent negative regulators of skeletal muscle mass. However, expression of both Myostatin and its cognate receptors in other tissues, including brain and peripheral nerves, suggests a potential wider biological role. Here, we show that Myoglianin (MYO), the Drosophila homolog of Myostatin and GDF11, regulates not only body weight and muscle size, but also inhibits neuromuscular synapse strength and composition in a Smad2-dependent manner. Both Myostatin and GDF11 affected synapse formation in isolated rat cortical neuron cultures, suggesting an effect on synaptogenesis beyond neuromuscular junctions. We also show that Myoglianin acts in vivo to inhibit synaptic transmission between neurons in the escape response neural circuit of adult flies. Thus, these anti-myogenic proteins act as important inhibitors of synapse function and neuronal growth.

%X INTRODUCTION: In systems biology, where a main goal is acquiring knowledge of biological systems, one of the challenges is inferring biochemical interactions from different molecular entities such as metabolites. In this area, the metabolome possesses a unique place for reflecting "true exposure" by being sensitive to variation coming from genetics, time, and environmental stimuli. While influenced by many different reactions, often the research interest needs to be focused on variation coming from a certain source, i.e. a certain covariable [Formula: see text]. OBJECTIVE: Here, we use network analysis methods to recover a set of metabolite relationships, by finding metabolites sharing a similar relation to [Formula: see text]. Metabolite values are based on information coming from individuals' [Formula: see text] status which might interact with other covariables. METHODS: Alternative to using the original metabolite values, the total information is decomposed by utilizing a linear regression model and the part relevant to [Formula: see text] is further used. For two datasets, two different network estimation methods are considered. The first is weighted gene co-expression network analysis based on correlation coefficients. The second method is graphical LASSO based on partial correlations. RESULTS: We observed that when using the parts related to the specific covariable of interest, resulting estimated networks display higher interconnectedness. Additionally, several groups of biologically associated metabolites (very large density lipoproteins, lipoproteins, etc.) were identified in the human data example. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates how information on the study design can be incorporated to estimate metabolite networks. As a result, sets of interconnected metabolites can be clustered together with respect to their relation to a covariable of interest.

%X Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the development of disease. Understanding the biological molecules and mechanisms that modulate aging is therefore critical for the development of health-maximizing interventions for older people. The effect of fats on longevity has traditionally been disregarded as purely detrimental. However, new studies are starting to uncover the possible beneficial effects of lipids working as signaling molecules on health and longevity. These studies highlight the complex links between aging and lipid signaling. In this review we summarize accumulating evidence that points to changes in lipid metabolism, and in particular lipid signaling, as an underlying mechanism for healthy aging.

%X BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) identifies the sites on RNAs that are in direct contact with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Several variants of CLIP exist, which require different computational approaches for analysis. This variety of approaches can create challenges for a novice user and can hamper insights from multi-study comparisons. Here, we produce data with multiple variants of CLIP and evaluate the data with various computational methods to better understand their suitability. RESULTS: We perform experiments for PTBP1 and eIF4A3 using individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP (iCLIP), employing either UV-C or photoactivatable 4-thiouridine (4SU) combined with UV-A crosslinking and compare the results with published data. As previously noted, the positions of complementary DNA (cDNA)-starts depend on cDNA length in several iCLIP experiments and we now find that this is caused by constrained cDNA-ends, which can result from the sequence and structure constraints of RNA fragmentation. These constraints are overcome when fragmentation by RNase I is efficient and when a broad cDNA size range is obtained. Our study also shows that if RNase does not efficiently cut within the binding sites, the original CLIP method is less capable of identifying the longer binding sites of RBPs. In contrast, we show that a broad size range of cDNAs in iCLIP allows the cDNA-starts to efficiently delineate the complete RNA-binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the advantage of iCLIP and related methods that can amplify cDNAs that truncate at crosslink sites and we show that computational analyses based on cDNAs-starts are appropriate for such methods.

%X Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) activates the atypical soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) in addition to transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs). Both cAMP sources were shown to be required for the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 triggered by activated G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CRHR1 in neuronal and neuroendocrine contexts. Here, we show that activated CRHR1 promotes growth arrest and neurite elongation in neuronal hippocampal cells (HT22-CRHR1 cells). By characterising CRHR1 signalling mechanisms involved in the neuritogenic effect, we demonstrate that neurite outgrowth in HT22-CRHR1 cells takes place by a sAC-dependent, ERK1/2-independent signalling cascade. Both tmACs and sAC are involved in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-mediated CREB phosphorylation and c-fos induction, but only sAC-generated cAMP pools are critical for the neuritogenic effect of CRH, further highlighting the engagement of two sources of cAMP downstream of the activation of a GPCR, and reinforcing the notion that restricted cAMP microdomains may regulate independent cellular processes.

%X Nrf2, a transcriptional activator of cell protection genes, is an attractive therapeutic target for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current Nrf2 activators, however, may exert toxicity and pathway over-activation can induce detrimental effects. An understanding of the mechanisms mediating Nrf2 inhibition in neurodegenerative conditions may therefore direct the design of drugs targeted for the prevention of these diseases with minimal side-effects. Our study provides the first in vivo evidence that specific inhibition of Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, can prevent neuronal toxicity in response to the AD-initiating Abeta42 peptide, in correlation with Nrf2 activation. Comparatively, lithium, an inhibitor of the Nrf2 suppressor GSK-3, prevented Abeta42 toxicity by mechanisms independent of Nrf2. A new direct inhibitor of the Keap1-Nrf2 binding domain also prevented synaptotoxicity mediated by naturally-derived Abeta oligomers in mouse cortical neurons. Overall, our findings highlight Keap1 specifically as an efficient target for the re-activation of Nrf2 in AD, and support the further investigation of direct Keap1 inhibitors for the prevention of neurodegeneration in vivo.

%X Site-specific histone ubiquitylation plays a central role in orchestrating the response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs elicit a cascade of events controlled by the ubiquitin ligase RNF168, which promotes the accumulation of repair factors such as 53BP1 and BRCA1 on the chromatin flanking the break site. RNF168 also promotes its own accumulation, and that of its paralog RNF169, but how they recognize ubiquitylated chromatin is unknown. Using methyl-TROSY solution NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we present an atomic resolution model of human RNF169 binding to a ubiquitylated nucleosome, and validate it by electron cryomicroscopy. We establish that RNF169 binds to ubiquitylated H2A-Lys13/Lys15 in a manner that involves its canonical ubiquitin-binding helix and a pair of arginine-rich motifs that interact with the nucleosome acidic patch. This three-pronged interaction mechanism is distinct from that by which 53BP1 binds to ubiquitylated H2A-Lys15 highlighting the diversity in site-specific recognition of ubiquitylated nucleosomes.

%X Dysfunction of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system is a major cause of human disease and the cellular consequences are highly complex. Here, we present comparative analyses of mitochondrial proteomes, cellular transcriptomes and targeted metabolomics of five knockout mouse strains deficient in essential factors required for mitochondrial DNA gene expression, leading to OXPHOS dysfunction. Moreover, we describe sequential protein changes during post-natal development and progressive OXPHOS dysfunction in time course analyses in control mice and a middle lifespan knockout, respectively. Very unexpectedly, we identify a new response pathway to OXPHOS dysfunction in which the intra-mitochondrial synthesis of coenzyme Q (ubiquinone, Q) and Q levels are profoundly decreased, pointing towards novel possibilities for therapy. Our extensive omics analyses provide a high-quality resource of altered gene expression patterns under severe OXPHOS deficiency comparing several mouse models, that will deepen our understanding, open avenues for research and provide an important reference for diagnosis and treatment.

%X Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 knock out screens provide a valuable addition to the methods available for novel drug target identification and validation. However, where gene editing is targeted to amplified loci, the resulting multiple DNA cleavage events can be a cause of false positive hit identification. The generation of nuclease deficient versions of Cas9 has enabled the development of two additional techniques - CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) - that enable the repression or overexpression, respectively, of target genes. Here we report the first direct combination of all three approaches (CRISPRko, CRISPRi and CRISPRa) in the context of genome-wide screens to identify components that influence resistance and sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib. The pairing of both loss- and gain-of-function datasets reveals complex gene networks which control drug response and illustrates how such data can add substantial confidence to target identification and validation analyses.

%X Environmental conditions experienced during animal development are thought to have sustained impact on maturation and adult lifespan. Here we show that in the model organism C. elegans developmental rate and adult lifespan depend on larval population density, and that this effect is mediated by excreted small molecules. By using the time point of first egg laying as a marker for full maturity, we found that wildtype hermaphrodites raised under high density conditions developed significantly faster than animals raised in isolation. Population density-dependent acceleration of development (Pdda) was dramatically enhanced in fatty acid beta-oxidation mutants that are defective in the biosynthesis of ascarosides, small-molecule signals that induce developmental diapause. In contrast, Pdda is abolished by synthetic ascarosides and steroidal ligands of the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12. We show that neither ascarosides nor any known steroid hormones are required for Pdda and that another chemical signal mediates this phenotype, in part via the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-8. Our results demonstrate that C. elegans development is regulated by a push-pull mechanism, based on two antagonistic chemical signals: chemosensation of ascarosides slows down development, whereas population-density dependent accumulation of a different chemical signal accelerates development. We further show that the effects of high larval population density persist through adulthood, as C. elegans larvae raised at high densities exhibit significantly reduced adult lifespan and respond differently to exogenous chemical signals compared to larvae raised at low densities, independent of density during adulthood. Our results demonstrate how inter-organismal signaling during development regulates reproductive maturation and longevity.

%X Respiratory chain dysfunction plays an important role in human disease and aging. It is now well established that the individual respiratory complexes can be organized into supercomplexes, and structures for these macromolecular assemblies, determined by electron cryo-microscopy, have been described recently. Nevertheless, the reason why supercomplexes exist remains an enigma. The widely held view that they enhance catalysis by channeling substrates is challenged by both structural and biophysical information. Here, we evaluate and discuss data and hypotheses on the structures, roles, and assembly of respiratory-chain supercomplexes and propose a future research agenda to address unanswered questions.

%X Cells are constantly subjected to a spectrum of mechanical cues, such as shear stress, compression, differential tissue rigidity and strain, to which they adapt by engaging mechanisms of mechanotransduction. While the central role of cell adhesion receptors in this process is established, it has only recently been appreciated that mechanical cues reach far beyond the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton, and are directly transmitted to the nucleus. Furthermore, changes in the mechanical properties of the perinuclear cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin are critical for cellular responses and adaptation to external mechanical cues. In that respect, dynamic changes in the nuclear lamina and the surrounding cytoskeleton modify mechanical properties of the nucleus, thereby protecting genetic material from damage. The importance of this mechanism is highlighted by debilitating genetic diseases, termed laminopathies, that result from impaired mechanoresistance of the nuclear lamina. What has been less evident, and represents one of the exciting emerging concepts, is that chromatin itself is an active rheological element of the nucleus, which undergoes dynamic changes upon application of force, thereby facilitating cellular adaption to differential force environments. This Review aims to highlight these emerging concepts by discussing the latest literature in this area and by proposing an integrative model of cytoskeletal and chromatin-mediated responses to mechanical stress.

%X An intronic GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 is the most common known cause of both frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The repeat expansion leads to the generation of sense and antisense repeat RNA aggregates and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, generated by repeat-associated non-ATG translation. The arginine-rich DPR proteins poly(glycine-arginine or GR) and poly(proline-arginine or PR) are potently neurotoxic and can localise to the nucleolus when expressed in cells, resulting in enlarged nucleoli with disrupted functionality. Furthermore, GGGGCC repeat RNA can bind nucleolar proteins in vitro. However, the relevance of nucleolar stress is unclear, as the arginine-rich DPR proteins do not localise to the nucleolus in C9orf72-associated FTLD/ALS (C9FTLD/ALS) patient brain. We measured nucleolar size in C9FTLD frontal cortex neurons using a three-dimensional, volumetric approach. Intriguingly, we found that C9FTLD brain exhibited bidirectional nucleolar stress. C9FTLD neuronal nucleoli were significantly smaller than control neuronal nucleoli. However, within C9FTLD brains, neurons containing poly(GR) inclusions had significantly larger nucleolar volumes than neurons without poly(GR) inclusions. In addition, expression of poly(GR) in adult Drosophila neurons led to significantly enlarged nucleoli. A small but significant increase in nucleolar volume was also observed in C9FTLD frontal cortex neurons containing GGGGCC repeat-containing RNA foci. These data show that nucleolar abnormalities are a consistent feature of C9FTLD brain, but that diverse pathomechanisms are at play, involving both DPR protein and repeat RNA toxicity.

%X A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Pathogenesis may occur either due to loss of function of the C9orf72 gene, or a toxic gain of function, via the production of repetitive sense and antisense RNA and/or repetitive dipeptide repeat proteins. Recently, mouse knockouts have suggested that a loss of function of C9orf72 alone is insufficient to lead to neurodegeneration, whilst overexpression of hexanucleotide DNA is sufficient in a wide range of model systems. Additionally, models have now been created to attempt to study the effects of repetitive RNA and dipeptide proteins in isolation and thus determine their relevance to disease.

%X Like many other neurodegenerative diseases, age is a major risk factor in the development of ALS/FTD. But why is this the case? Recent genetic advances have highlighted some of pathways involved in the development of disease, and, strikingly, they appear to substantially overlap with those known to directly modulate the ageing process. Many ALS/FTD linked genes play a direct role in autophagy/lysosomal degradation, one of the most important pathways linked to ageing. However, systemic processes such as inflammation, as well as cellular maintenance pathways, including RNA splicing and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport have been increasingly linked both to disease and ageing. We highlight some of the shared mechanisms between the ageing process itself and emerging pathogenic mechanisms in ALS/FTD.

%X Topological distributions of individual cellular clocks have not been demonstrated in peripheral organs. The cochlea displays circadian patterns of core clock gene expression [1, 2]. PER2 protein is expressed in the hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons of the cochlea in the spiral ganglion neurons [1]. To investigate the topological organization of cellular oscillators in the cochlea, we recorded circadian rhythms from mouse cochlear explants using highly sensitive real-time tracking of PER2::LUC bioluminescence. Here, we show cell-autonomous and self-sustained oscillations originating from hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Multi-phased cellular clocks were arranged along the length of the cochlea with oscillations initiating at the apex (low-frequency region) and traveling toward the base (high-frequency region). Phase differences of 3 hr were found between cellular oscillators in the apical and middle regions and from isolated individual cochlear regions, indicating that cellular networks organize the rhythms along the tonotopic axis. This is the first demonstration of a spatiotemporal arrangement of circadian clocks at the cellular level in a peripheral organ. Cochlear rhythms were disrupted in the presence of either voltage-gated potassium channel blocker (TEA) or extracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA), demonstrating that multiple types of ion channels contribute to the maintenance of coherent rhythms. In contrast, preventing action potentials with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or interfering with cell-to-cell communication the broad-spectrum gap junction blocker (CBX [carbenoxolone]) had no influence on cochlear rhythms. These findings highlight a dynamic regulation and longitudinal distribution of cellular clocks in the cochlea.

%X Balancing the quantity and quality of dietary protein relative to other nutrients is a key determinant of evolutionary fitness. A theoretical framework for defining a balanced diet would both reduce the enormous workload to optimize diets empirically and represent a breakthrough toward tailoring diets to the needs of consumers. Here, we report a simple and powerful in silico technique that uses the genome information of an organism to define its dietary amino acid requirements. We show for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that such "exome-matched" diets are more satiating, enhance growth, and increase reproduction relative to non-matched diets. Thus, early life fitness traits can be enhanced at low levels of dietary amino acids that do not impose a cost to lifespan. Exome matching also enhanced mouse growth, indicating that it can be applied to other organisms whose genome sequence is known.

%X Many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate both alternative exons and poly(A) site selection. To understand their regulatory principles, we developed expressRNA, a web platform encompassing computational tools for integration of iCLIP and RNA motif analyses with RNA-seq and 3' mRNA sequencing. This reveals at nucleotide resolution the "RNA maps" describing how the RNA binding positions of RBPs relate to their regulatory functions. We use this approach to examine how TDP-43, an RBP involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, binds around its regulated poly(A) sites. Binding close to the poly(A) site generally represses, whereas binding further downstream enhances use of the site, which is similar to TDP-43 binding around regulated exons. Our RNAmotifs2 software also identifies sequence motifs that cluster together with the binding motifs of TDP-43. We conclude that TDP-43 directly regulates diverse types of pre-mRNA processing according to common position-dependent principles.

%X Generation of a barrier in multi-layered epithelia like the epidermis requires restricted positioning of functional tight junctions (TJ) to the most suprabasal viable layer. This positioning necessitates tissue-level polarization of junctions and the cytoskeleton through unknown mechanisms. Using quantitative whole-mount imaging, genetic ablation, and traction force microscopy and atomic force microscopy, we find that ubiquitously localized E-cadherin coordinates tissue polarization of tension-bearing adherens junction (AJ) and F-actin organization to allow formation of an apical TJ network only in the uppermost viable layer. Molecularly, E-cadherin localizes and tunes EGFR activity and junctional tension to inhibit premature TJ complex formation in lower layers while promoting increased tension and TJ stability in the granular layer 2. In conclusion, our data identify an E-cadherin-dependent mechanical circuit that integrates adhesion, contractile forces and biochemical signaling to drive the polarized organization of junctional tension necessary to build an in vivo epithelial barrier.

%X Mitochondria drive apoptosis by releasing pro-apoptotic proteins that promote caspase activation in the cytosol. The rhomboid protease PARL, an intramembrane cleaving peptidase in the inner membrane, regulates mitophagy and plays an ill-defined role in apoptosis. Here, we employed PARL-based proteomics to define its substrate spectrum. Our data identified the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic protein Smac (also known as DIABLO) as a PARL substrate. In apoptotic cells, Smac is released into the cytosol and promotes caspase activity by inhibiting inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Intramembrane cleavage of Smac by PARL generates an amino-terminal IAP-binding motif, which is required for its apoptotic activity. Loss of PARL impairs proteolytic maturation of Smac, which fails to bind XIAP. Smac peptidomimetics, downregulation of XIAP or cytosolic expression of cleaved Smac restores apoptosis in PARL-deficient cells. Our results reveal a pro-apoptotic function of PARL and identify PARL-mediated Smac processing and cytochrome c release facilitated by OPA1-dependent cristae remodelling as two independent pro-apoptotic pathways in mitochondria.

%X Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, POLG, are associated with a variety of clinical presentations, ranging from early onset fatal brain disease in Alpers syndrome to chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. The majority of mutations are linked with disturbances of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity and maintenance. On a molecular level, depending on their location within the enzyme, mutations either lead to mtDNA depletion or the accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions, and in some cases these molecular changes can be correlated to the clinical presentation. We identified a patient with a dominant p.Y955H mutation in POLG, presenting with a severe, early-onset multi-systemic mitochondrial disease with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, cataract, myopathy, and liver failure. Using a combination of disease models of Drosophila melanogaster and in vitro biochemistry analysis, we compare the molecular consequences of the p.Y955H mutation to the well-documented p.Y955C mutation. We demonstrate that both mutations affect mtDNA replication and display a dominant negative effect, with the p.Y955H allele resulting in a more severe polymerase dysfunction.

%X The expression of the compact mammalian mitochondrial genome requires transcription, RNA processing, translation and RNA decay, much like the more complex chromosomal systems, and here we use it as a model system to understand the fundamental aspects of gene expression. Here we combine RNase footprinting with PAR-CLIP at unprecedented depth to reveal the importance of RNA-protein interactions in dictating RNA folding within the mitochondrial transcriptome. We show that LRPPRC, in complex with its protein partner SLIRP, binds throughout the mitochondrial transcriptome, with a preference for mRNAs, and its loss affects the entire secondary structure and stability of the transcriptome. We demonstrate that the LRPPRC-SLIRP complex is a global RNA chaperone that stabilizes RNA structures to expose the required sites for translation, stabilization, and polyadenylation. Our findings reveal a general mechanism where extensive RNA-protein interactions ensure that RNA is accessible for its biological functions.

%X Mitochondrial functions and architecture rely on a defined lipid composition of their outer and inner membranes, which are characterized by a high content of non-bilayer phospholipids such as cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Mitochondrial membrane lipids are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or within mitochondria from ER-derived precursor lipids, are asymmetrically distributed within mitochondria and can relocate in response to cellular stress. Maintenance of lipid homeostasis thus requires multiple lipid transport processes to be orchestrated within mitochondria. Recent findings identified members of the Ups/PRELI family as specific lipid transfer proteins in mitochondria that shuttle phospholipids between mitochondrial membranes. They cooperate with membrane organizing proteins that preserve the spatial organization of mitochondrial membranes and the formation of membrane contact sites, unravelling an intimate crosstalk of membrane lipid transport and homeostasis with the structural organization of mitochondria. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Lipids of Mitochondria edited by Guenther Daum.

%X Animal lifespan is regulated by conserved metabolic signalling pathways and specific transcription factors, but whether these pathways affect common downstream mechanisms remains largely elusive. Here we show that NCL-1/TRIM2/Brat tumour suppressor extends lifespan and limits nucleolar size in the major C. elegans longevity pathways, as part of a convergent mechanism focused on the nucleolus. Long-lived animals representing distinct longevity pathways exhibit small nucleoli, and decreased expression of rRNA, ribosomal proteins, and the nucleolar protein fibrillarin, dependent on NCL-1. Knockdown of fibrillarin also reduces nucleolar size and extends lifespan. Among wildtype C. elegans, individual nucleolar size varies, but is highly predictive for longevity. Long-lived dietary restricted fruit flies and insulin-like-peptide mutants exhibit small nucleoli and fibrillarin expression, as do long-lived dietary restricted and IRS1 knockout mice. Furthermore, human muscle biopsies from individuals who underwent modest dietary restriction coupled with exercise also display small nucleoli. We suggest that small nucleoli are a cellular hallmark of longevity and metabolic health conserved across taxa.

%X The RNA-binding protein LIN-28 was first found to control developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans. Later, it was found to play important roles in pluripotency, metabolism, and cancer in mammals. Here we report that a low dosage of lin-28 enhanced stress tolerance and longevity, and reduced germline stem/progenitor cell number in C. elegans. The germline LIN-28-regulated microRNA let-7 was required for these effects by targeting akt-1/2 and decreasing their protein levels. AKT-1/2 and the downstream DAF-16 transcription factor were both required for the lifespan and germline stem cell effects of lin-28. The pathway also mediated dietary restriction induced lifespan extension and reduction in germline stem cell number. Thus, the LIN-28/let-7/AKT/DAF-16 axis we delineated here is a program that plays an important role in balancing reproduction and somatic maintenance and their response to the environmental energy level-a central dogma of the 'evolutionary optimization' of resource allocation that modulates aging.

%X Understanding the physiological mechanisms by which common variants predispose to type 2 diabetes requires large studies with detailed measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity. Here we performed the largest genome-wide association study of first-phase insulin secretion, as measured by intravenous glucose tolerance tests, using up to 5,567 individuals without diabetes from 10 studies. We aimed to refine the mechanisms of 178 known associations between common variants and glycemic traits and identify new loci. Thirty type 2 diabetes or fasting glucose-raising alleles were associated with a measure of first-phase insulin secretion at P < 0.05 and provided new evidence, or the strongest evidence yet, that insulin secretion, intrinsic to the islet cells, is a key mechanism underlying the associations at the HNF1A, IGF2BP2, KCNQ1, HNF1B, VPS13C/C2CD4A, FAF1, PTPRD, AP3S2, KCNK16, MAEA, LPP, WFS1, and TMPRSS6 loci. The fasting glucose-raising allele near PDX1, a known key insulin transcription factor, was strongly associated with lower first-phase insulin secretion but has no evidence for an effect on type 2 diabetes risk. The diabetes risk allele at TCF7L2 was associated with a stronger effect on peak insulin response than on C-peptide-based insulin secretion rate, suggesting a possible additional role in hepatic insulin clearance or insulin processing. In summary, our study provides further insight into the mechanisms by which common genetic variation influences type 2 diabetes risk and glycemic traits.

%X How eukaryotic chromosomes are compacted during mitosis has been a leading question in cell biology since the nineteenth century. Non-histone proteins such as condensin complexes contribute to chromosome shaping, but appear not to be necessary for mitotic chromatin compaction. Histone modifications are known to affect chromatin structure. As histones undergo major changes in their post-translational modifications during mitotic entry, we speculated that the spectrum of cell-cycle-specific histone modifications might contribute to chromosome compaction during mitosis. To test this hypothesis, we isolated core histones from interphase and mitotic cells and reconstituted chromatin with them. We used mass spectrometry to show that key post-translational modifications remained intact during our isolation procedure. Light, atomic force and transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that chromatin assembled from mitotic histones has a much greater tendency to aggregate than chromatin assembled from interphase histones, even under low magnesium conditions where interphase chromatin remains as separate beads-on-a-string structures. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that mitotic chromosome formation is a two-stage process with changes in the spectrum of histone post-translational modifications driving mitotic chromatin compaction, while the action of non-histone proteins such as condensin may then shape the condensed chromosomes into their classic mitotic morphology.

%X Many increasingly prevalent diseases share a common risk factor: age. However, little is known about pharmaceutical interventions against aging, despite many genes and pathways shown to be important in the aging process and numerous studies demonstrating that genetic interventions can lead to a healthier aging phenotype. An important challenge is to assess the potential to repurpose existing drugs for initial testing on model organisms, where such experiments are possible. To this end, we present a new approach to rank drug-like compounds with known mammalian targets according to their likelihood to modulate aging in the invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. Our approach combines information on genetic effects on aging, orthology relationships and sequence conservation, 3D protein structures, drug binding and bioavailability. Overall, we rank 743 different drug-like compounds for their likelihood to modulate aging. We provide various lines of evidence for the successful enrichment of our ranking for compounds modulating aging, despite sparse public data suitable for validation. The top ranked compounds are thus prime candidates for in vivo testing of their effects on lifespan in C. elegans or Drosophila. As such, these compounds are promising as research tools and ultimately a step towards identifying drugs for a healthier human aging.

%X The rapid elimination of dying neurons and nonfunctional synapses in the brain is carried out by microglia, the resident myeloid cells of the brain. Here we show that microglia clearance activity in the adult brain is regionally regulated and depends on the rate of neuronal attrition. Cerebellar, but not striatal or cortical, microglia exhibited high levels of basal clearance activity, which correlated with an elevated degree of cerebellar neuronal attrition. Exposing forebrain microglia to apoptotic cells activated gene-expression programs supporting clearance activity. We provide evidence that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetically restricts the expression of genes that support clearance activity in striatal and cortical microglia. Loss of PRC2 leads to aberrant activation of a microglia clearance phenotype, which triggers changes in neuronal morphology and behavior. Our data highlight a key role of epigenetic mechanisms in preventing microglia-induced neuronal alterations that are frequently associated with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.

%X Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are responsible for several metabolic disorders, commonly involving muscle and the central nervous system(1). Because of the critical role of mtDNA in oxidative phosphorylation, the majority of pathogenic mtDNA mutations are heteroplasmic, co-existing with wild-type molecules(1). Using a mouse model with a heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation(2), we tested whether mitochondrial-targeted TALENs (mitoTALENs)(3,4) could reduce the mutant mtDNA load in muscle and heart. AAV9-mitoTALEN was administered via intramuscular, intravenous, and intraperitoneal injections. Muscle and heart were efficiently transduced and showed a robust reduction in mutant mtDNA, which was stable over time. The molecular defect, namely a decrease in transfer RNA(Ala) levels, was restored by the treatment. These results showed that mitoTALENs, when expressed in affected tissues, could revert disease-related phenotypes in mice.

%X The Toxoplasma gondii locus mitochondrial association factor 1 (MAF1) encodes multiple paralogs, some of which mediate host mitochondrial association (HMA). Previous work showed that HMA was a trait that arose in T. gondii through neofunctionalization of an ancestral MAF1 ortholog. Structural analysis of HMA-competent and incompetent MAF1 paralogs (MAF1b and MAF1a, respectively) revealed that both paralogs harbor an ADP ribose binding macro-domain, with comparatively low (micromolar) affinity for ADP ribose. Replacing the 16 C-terminal residues of MAF1b with those of MAF1a abrogated HMA, and we also show that only three residues in the C-terminal helix are required for MAF1-mediated HMA. Importantly these same three residues are also required for the in vivo growth advantage conferred by MAF1b, providing a definitive link between in vivo proliferation and manipulation of host mitochondria. Co-immunoprecipitation assays reveal that the ability to interact with the mitochondrial MICOS complex is shared by HMA-competent and incompetent MAF1 paralogs and mutants. The weak ADPr coordination and ability to interact with the MICOS complex shared between divergent paralogs may represent modular ancestral functions for this tandemly expanded and diversified T. gondii locus.

%X During the last decade, the study of mRNA decay has largely benefited from an increasing number of high-throughput assays that emerged from developments in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies as well as mass spectrometry. While assay-specific data analysis is often reported and software made available many researchers struggle with the overwhelming challenge of integrating data from diverse assays, different sources, and of different formats.We here use Python, R, and bash to analyze and integrate RNAseq and eCLIP data publicly available from ENCODE. Annotation is performed with biomart, motif analysis with MEME and finally a functional enrichment analysis using DAVID. This analysis is centered on KHSRP eCLIP data from K562 cell as well as RNAseq data from KHSRP knockdown and respective mock controls.

%X ADP-ribosylation is a technically challenging PTM which has just emerged into the field of PTM-specific proteomics. But this fragile modifier requires special treatment on both a data acquisition and data processing level: it is highly labile under higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), and the degree of lability can depend on the site it modifies. Its behavior thus violates some assumptions on which proteomics algorithms are based. Here we present nonlocalized ADPr searching: a simple principle for maximizing sensitivity toward ADP-ribosylation when searching conventional HCD data. By scoring the strong fragment ions generally observed in ADPr spectra rather than the weak and often absent localization-dependent ions, nonlocalized searches are more sensitive. They also run significantly faster, due to reduced search space, and require no assumptions about which amino acids can be modified. We illustrate implementation in three search systems: Morpheus, MaxQuant, and MASCOT, and we also present a means of rapidly finding and extracting ADP-ribosylated peptide spectra from large datasets for more focused searching. This approach both improves identification of ADP-ribosylated peptides and avoids mis-localization of the modification sites.

%X Proper and timely regulation of cellular processes is fundamental to the overall health and viability of organisms across all kingdoms of life. Thus, organisms have evolved multiple highly dynamic and complex biochemical signaling cascades in order to adapt and survive diverse challenges. One such method of conferring rapid adaptation is the addition or removal of reversible modifications of different chemical groups onto macromolecules which in turn induce the appropriate downstream outcome. ADP-ribosylation, the addition of ADP-ribose (ADPr) groups, represents one of these highly conserved signaling chemicals. Herein we outline the writers, erasers and readers of ADP-ribosylation and dip into the multitude of cellular processes they have been implicated in. We also review what we currently know on how specificity of activity is ensured for this important modification.

%X Mutations of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) underlie a substantial portion of mitochondrial disease burden. These disorders are currently incurable and effectively untreatable, with heterogeneous penetrance, presentation and prognosis. To address the lack of effective treatment for these disorders, we exploited a recently developed mouse model that recapitulates common molecular features of heteroplasmic mtDNA disease in cardiac tissue: the m.5024C>T tRNA(Ala) mouse. Through application of a programmable nuclease therapy approach, using systemically administered, mitochondrially targeted zinc-finger nucleases (mtZFN) delivered by adeno-associated virus, we induced specific elimination of mutant mtDNA across the heart, coupled to a reversion of molecular and biochemical phenotypes. These findings constitute proof of principle that mtDNA heteroplasmy correction using programmable nucleases could provide a therapeutic route for heteroplasmic mitochondrial diseases of diverse genetic origin.

%X Human ageing is an extremely personal process leading across the life course of individuals to large population heterogeneity in the decline of functional capacity, health and lifespan. The extremes of this process are witnessed by the healthy vital 100-year-olds on one end and the 60-year-olds suffering from multiple morbid conditions on the other end of the spectrum. Molecular studies into the basis of this heterogeneity have focused on a range of endpoints and methodological approaches. The phenotype definitions most prominently investigated in these studies are either lifespan-related or biomarker based indices of the biological ageing rate of individuals and their tissues. Unlike for many complex, age-related diseases, consensus on the ultimate set of multi-biomarker ageing or lifespan-related phenotypes for genetic and genomic studies has not been reached yet. Comparable to animal models, hallmarks of age-related disease risk, healthy ageing and longevity include immune and metabolic pathways. Potentially novel genomic regions and pathways have been identified among many (epi)genomic studies into chronological age and studies into human lifespan regulation, with APOE and FOXO3A representing yet the most robust loci. Functional analysis of a handful of genes in cell-based and animal models is ongoing. The way forward in human ageing and longevity studies seems through improvements in the interpretation of the biology of the genome, in application of computational and systems biology, integration with animal models and by harmonization of repeated phenotypic and omics measures in longitudinal and intervention studies.

%X High blood pressure is a highly heritable and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We report the largest genetic association study of blood pressure traits (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure) to date in over 1 million people of European ancestry. We identify 535 novel blood pressure loci that not only offer new biological insights into blood pressure regulation but also highlight shared genetic architecture between blood pressure and lifestyle exposures. Our findings identify new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation with potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future.

%X Between the 1930s and 50s, evolutionary biologists developed a successful theory of why organisms age, firmly rooted in population genetic principles. By the 1980s the evolution of aging had a secure experimental basis. Since the force of selection declines with age, aging evolves due to mutation accumulation or a benefit to fitness early in life. Here we review major insights and challenges that have emerged over the last 35 years: selection does not always necessarily decline with age; higher extrinsic (i.e., environmentally caused) mortality does not always accelerate aging; conserved pathways control aging rate; senescence patterns are more diverse than previously thought; aging is not universal; trade-offs involving lifespan can be 'broken'; aging might be 'druggable'; and human life expectancy continues to rise but compressing late-life morbidity remains a pressing challenge.

%X Mitochondria are increasingly recognized for playing important roles in regulating the evolving metabolic state of mammalian cells. This is particularly true for nerve cells, as dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics is invariably associated with a number of neuropathies. Accumulating evidence now reveals that changes in mitochondrial dynamics and structure may play equally important roles also in the cell biology of astroglial cells. Astroglial cells display significant heterogeneity in their morphology and specialized functions across different brain regions, however besides fundamental differences they seem to share a surprisingly complex meshwork of mitochondria, which is highly suggestive of tightly regulated mechanisms that contribute to maintain this unique architecture. Here, we summarize recent work performed in astrocytes in situ indicating that this may indeed be the case, with astrocytic mitochondrial networks shown to experience rapid dynamic changes in response to defined external cues. Although the mechanisms underlying this degree of mitochondrial re-shaping are far from being understood, recent data suggest that they may contribute to demarcate astrocyte territories undergoing key signalling and metabolic functions.

%X Lipid droplets are conserved specialized organelles that store neutral lipids. Our view on this unique organelle has evolved from a simple fat deposit to a highly dynamic and functionally diverse hub-one that mediates the buffering of fatty acid stress and the adaptive reshaping of lipid metabolism to promote membrane and organelle homeostasis and the integrity of central proteostasis pathways, including autophagy, which ensure stress resistance and cell survival. This Review will summarize the recent developments in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as this model organism has been instrumental in deciphering the fundamental mechanisms and principles of lipid droplet biology and interconnecting lipid droplets with many unanticipated cellular functions applicable to many other cell systems.

%X Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulated insulin secretion has a considerable heritable component as estimated from twin studies, yet few genetic variants influencing this phenotype have been identified. We performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of GLP-1 stimulated insulin secretion in non-diabetic individuals from the Netherlands Twin register (n = 126). This GWAS was enhanced using a tissue-specific protein-protein interaction network approach. We identified a beta-cell protein-protein interaction module that was significantly enriched for low gene scores based on the GWAS P-values and found support at the network level in an independent cohort from Tubingen, Germany (n = 100). Additionally, a polygenic risk score based on SNPs prioritized from the network was associated (P < 0.05) with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion phenotypes in up to 5,318 individuals in MAGIC cohorts. The network contains both known and novel genes in the context of insulin secretion and is enriched for members of the focal adhesion, extracellular-matrix receptor interaction, actin cytoskeleton regulation, Rap1 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Adipose tissue is, like the beta-cell, one of the target tissues of GLP-1 and we thus hypothesized that similar networks might be functional in both tissues. In order to verify peripheral effects of GLP-1 stimulation, we compared the transcriptome profiling of ob/ob mice treated with liraglutide, a clinically used GLP-1 receptor agonist, versus baseline controls. Some of the upstream regulators of differentially expressed genes in the white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice were also detected in the human beta-cell network of genes associated with GLP-1 stimulated insulin secretion. The findings provide biological insight into the mechanisms through which the effects of GLP-1 may be modulated and highlight a potential role of the beta-cell expressed genes RYR2, GDI2, KIAA0232, COL4A1 and COL4A2 in GLP-1 stimulated insulin secretion.

%X Dietary, pharmacological and genetic interventions can extend health- and lifespan in diverse mammalian species. DNA methylation has been implicated in mediating the beneficial effects of these interventions; methylation patterns deteriorate during ageing, and this is prevented by lifespan-extending interventions. However, whether these interventions also actively shape the epigenome, and whether such epigenetic reprogramming contributes to improved health at old age, remains underexplored. We analysed published, whole-genome, BS-seq data sets from mouse liver to explore DNA methylation patterns in aged mice in response to three lifespan-extending interventions: dietary restriction (DR), reduced TOR signaling (rapamycin), and reduced growth (Ames dwarf mice). Dwarf mice show enhanced DNA hypermethylation in the body of key genes in lipid biosynthesis, cell proliferation and somatotropic signaling, which strongly correlates with the pattern of transcriptional repression. Remarkably, DR causes a similar hypermethylation in lipid biosynthesis genes, while rapamycin treatment increases methylation signatures in genes coding for growth factor and growth hormone receptors. Shared changes of DNA methylation were restricted to hypermethylated regions, and they were not merely a consequence of slowed ageing, thus suggesting an active mechanism driving their formation. By comparing the overlap in ageing-independent hypermethylated patterns between all three interventions, we identified four regions, which, independent of genetic background or gender, may serve as novel biomarkers for longevity-extending interventions. In summary, we identified gene body hypermethylation as a novel and partly conserved signature of lifespan-extending interventions in mouse, highlighting epigenetic reprogramming as a possible intervention to improve health at old age.

%X Deciphering the evolution of cancer cells under therapeutic pressure is a crucial step to understand the mechanisms that lead to treatment resistance. To this end, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data of eight chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients that developed resistance upon BCL2-inhibition by venetoclax. Here, we report recurrent mutations in BTG1 (2 patients) and homozygous deletions affecting CDKN2A/B (3 patients) that developed during treatment, as well as a mutation in BRAF and a high-level focal amplification of CD274 (PD-L1) that might pinpoint molecular aberrations offering structures for further therapeutic interventions.

%X Forward genetic screens in haploid mammalian cells have recently emerged as powerful tools for the discovery and investigation of recessive traits. Use of the haploid system provides unique genetic tractability and resolution. Upon positive selection, these screens typically employ analysis of loss-of-function (LOF) alleles and are thus limited to non-essential genes. Many relevant compounds, including anti-cancer therapeutics, however, target essential genes, precluding positive selection of LOF alleles. Here, we asked whether the use of random and saturating chemical mutagenesis might enable screens that identify essential biological targets of toxic compounds. We compare and contrast chemical mutagenesis with insertional mutagenesis. Selecting mutagenized cells with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the essential Ca(2+) pump SERCA2, insertional mutagenesis retrieved cell clones overexpressing SERCA2. With chemical mutagenesis, we identify six single amino acid substitutions in the known SERCA2-thapsigargin binding interface that confer drug resistance. In a second screen, we used the anti-cancer drug MG132/bortezomib (Velcade), which inhibits proteasome activity. Using chemical mutagenesis, we found 7 point mutations in the essential subunit Psmb5 that map to the bortezomib binding surface. Importantly, 4 of these had previously been identified in human tumors with acquired bortezomib resistance. Insertional mutagenesis did not identify Psmb5 in this screen, demonstrating the unique ability of chemical mutagenesis to identify relevant point mutations in essential genes. Thus, chemical mutagenesis in haploid embryonic stem cells can define the interaction of toxic small molecules with essential proteins at amino acid resolution, fully mapping small molecule-protein binding interfaces.

%X We established a modified iCLIP protocol, called 'read-through marking', which facilitates the detection of cDNAs that have not been truncated upon encountering the RNA-peptide complex during reverse transcription (read-through cDNAs). A large proportion of these cDNAs would be undesirable in an iCLIP library, as it could affect the resolution of the method. To this end, we added an oligonucleotide to the 5'-end of RNA fragments-a 5'-marker-to mark the read-through cDNAs. By applying this modified iCLIP protocol to PTBP1 and eIF4A3, we found that the start sites of read-through cDNAs are enriched in adenosines, while the remaining cDNAs have a markedly different sequence content at their starts, preferentially containing thymidines. This finding in turn indicates that most of the reads in our iCLIP libraries are a product of truncation with valuable information regarding the proteins' RNA-binding sites. Thus, cDNA start sites confidently identify a protein's RNA-crosslink sites and we can account for the impact of read-through cDNAs by commonly adding a 5'-marker.

%X Fibrillarin (FBL) is a dual-function nucleolar protein that catalyzes 2'-O methylation of pre-rRNA and methylation of histone H2A at glutamine 104 (H2AQ104me). The mechanisms that regulate FBL activity are unexplored. Here, we show that FBL is acetylated at several lysine residues by the acetyltransferase CBP and deacetylated by SIRT7. While reversible acetylation does not impact FBL-mediated pre-rRNA methylation, hyperacetylation impairs the interaction of FBL with histone H2A and chromatin, thereby compromising H2AQ104 methylation (H2AQ104me) and rDNA transcription. SIRT7-dependent deacetylation of FBL ensures H2AQ104me and high levels of rRNA synthesis during interphase. At the onset of mitosis, nucleolar disassembly is accompanied by hyperacetylation of FBL, loss of H2AQ104me, and repression of polymerase I (Pol I) transcription. Overexpression of an acetylation-deficient, but not an acetylation-mimicking, FBL mutant restores H2AQ104me and transcriptional activity. The results reveal that SIRT7-dependent deacetylation impacts nucleolar activity by an FBL-driven circuitry that mediates cell-cycle-dependent fluctuation of rDNA transcription.

%X Mammals develop age-associated clonal expansion of somatic mtDNA mutations resulting in severe respiratory chain deficiency in a subset of cells in a variety of tissues. Both mathematical modeling based on descriptive data from humans and experimental data from mtDNA mutator mice suggest that the somatic mutations are formed early in life and then undergo mitotic segregation during adult life to reach very high levels in certain cells. To address whether mtDNA mutations have a universal effect on aging metazoans, we investigated their role in physiology and aging of fruit flies. To this end, we utilized genetically engineered flies expressing mutant versions of the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase (DmPOLgammaA) as a means to introduce mtDNA mutations. We report here that lifespan and health in fruit flies are remarkably tolerant to mtDNA mutations. Our results show that the short lifespan and wide genetic bottleneck of fruit flies are limiting the extent of clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations both in individuals and between generations. However, an increase of mtDNA mutations to very high levels caused sensitivity to mechanical and starvation stress, intestinal stem cell dysfunction, and reduced lifespan under standard conditions. In addition, the effects of dietary restriction, widely considered beneficial for organismal health, were attenuated in flies with very high levels of mtDNA mutations.

%X Erroneous DNA repair by heterologous recombination (Ht-REC) is a potential threat to genome stability, but evidence supporting its prevalence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that recombination is possible between heterologous sequences and that it is a source of chromosomal alterations in mitotic and meiotic cells. Mechanistically, we find that the RTEL1 and HIM-6/BLM helicases and the BRCA1 homolog BRC-1 counteract Ht-REC in Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas mismatch repair does not. Instead, MSH-2/6 drives Ht-REC events in rtel-1 and brc-1 mutants and excessive crossovers in rtel-1 mutant meioses. Loss of vertebrate Rtel1 also causes a variety of unusually large and complex structural variations, including chromothripsis, breakage-fusion-bridge events, and tandem duplications with distant intra-chromosomal insertions, whose structure are consistent with a role for RTEL1 in preventing Ht-REC during break-induced replication. Our data establish Ht-REC as an unappreciated source of genome instability that underpins a novel class of complex genome rearrangements that likely arise during replication stress.

%X Telomere maintenance critically depends on the distinct activities of telomerase, which adds telomeric repeats to solve the end replication problem, and RTEL1, which dismantles DNA secondary structures at telomeres to facilitate replisome progression. Here, we establish that reversed replication forks are a pathological substrate for telomerase and the source of telomere catastrophe in Rtel1(-/-) cells. Inhibiting telomerase recruitment to telomeres, but not its activity, or blocking replication fork reversal through PARP1 inhibition or depleting UBC13 or ZRANB3 prevents the rapid accumulation of dysfunctional telomeres in RTEL1-deficient cells. In this context, we establish that telomerase binding to reversed replication forks inhibits telomere replication, which can be mimicked by preventing replication fork restart through depletion of RECQ1 or PARG. Our results lead us to propose that telomerase inappropriately binds to and inhibits restart of reversed replication forks within telomeres, which compromises replication and leads to critically short telomeres.

%X Replication of mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an essential process that requires high fidelity and control at multiple levels to ensure proper mitochondrial function. Mutations in the mitochondrial genome maintenance exonuclease 1 (MGME1) gene were recently reported in mitochondrial disease patients. Here, to study disease pathophysiology, we generated Mgme1 knockout mice and report that homozygous knockouts develop depletion and multiple deletions of mtDNA. The mtDNA replication stalling phenotypes vary dramatically in different tissues of Mgme1 knockout mice. Mice with MGME1 deficiency accumulate a long linear subgenomic mtDNA species, similar to the one found in mtDNA mutator mice, but do not develop progeria. This finding resolves a long-standing debate by showing that point mutations of mtDNA are the main cause of progeria in mtDNA mutator mice. We also propose a role for MGME1 in the regulation of replication and transcription termination at the end of the control region of mtDNA.

%X Mitochondrial diseases often result from mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). In most cases, mutant mtDNA coexists with wild-type mtDNA, resulting in heteroplasmy. One potential future approach to treat heteroplasmic mtDNA diseases is the specific elimination of pathogenic mtDNA mutations, lowering the level of mutant mtDNA below pathogenic thresholds. Mitochondrially targeted zinc-finger nucleases (mtZFNs) have been demonstrated to specifically target and introduce double-strand breaks in mutant mtDNA, facilitating substantial shifts in heteroplasmy. One application of mtZFN technology, in the context of heteroplasmic mtDNA disease, is delivery into the heteroplasmic oocyte or early embryo to eliminate mutant mtDNA, preventing transmission of mitochondrial diseases through the germline. Here we describe a protocol for efficient production of mtZFN mRNA in vitro, and delivery of these into 0.5 dpc mouse embryos to elicit shifts of mtDNA heteroplasmy.

%X To establish and maintain organ structure and function, tissues need to balance stem cell proliferation and differentiation rates and coordinate cell fate with position. By quantifying and modelling tissue stress and deformation in the mammalian epidermis, we find that this balance is coordinated through local mechanical forces generated by cell division and delamination. Proliferation within the basal stem/progenitor layer, which displays features of a jammed, solid-like state, leads to crowding, thereby locally distorting cell shape and stress distribution. The resulting decrease in cortical tension and increased cell-cell adhesion trigger differentiation and subsequent delamination, reinstating basal cell layer density. After delamination, cells establish a high-tension state as they increase myosin II activity and convert to E-cadherin-dominated adhesion, thereby reinforcing the boundary between basal and suprabasal layers. Our results uncover how biomechanical signalling integrates single-cell behaviours to couple proliferation, cell fate and positioning to generate a multilayered tissue.

%X OBJECTIVE: The current obesity pandemic represents a major health burden, given that it predisposes to the development of numerous obesity-associated disorders. The obesity-derived adipokines not only impair systemic insulin action but also increase the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly prevalent cancer with poor prognosis. Thus, worldwide incidences of HCC are expected to further increase, and defining the molecular as well as cellular mechanisms will allow for establishing new potential treatment options. The adipose tissue of obese individuals increases circulating leptin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, which both share similar signaling capacities such as Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation. While mouse models with deficient IL-6 signaling show an ameliorated but not absent Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC development, the morbid obesity in mice with mutant leptin signaling complicates the dissection of hepatic leptin receptor (LEPR) and IL-6 signaling in HCC development. Here we have investigated the function of compensating hepatic LEPR expression in HCC development of IL-6Rα-deficient mice. METHODS: We generated and characterized a mouse model of hepatic LEPR deficiency that was intercrossed with IL-6Rα-deficient mice. Cohorts of single and double knockout mice were subjected to the DEN-HCC model to ascertain liver cancer development and characterize metabolic alterations. RESULTS: We demonstrate that both high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and IL-6Rα deficiency induce hepatic Lepr expression. Consistently, double knockout mice show a further reduction in tumor burden in DEN-induced HCC when compared to control and single LepR(L-KO)/IL-6Rα knock out mice, whereas metabolism remained largely unaltered between the genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a compensatory role for hepatic LEPR in HCC development of IL-6Rα-deficient mice and suggest hepatocyte-specific leptin signaling as promoter of HCC under obese conditions.

%X A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Neurodegeneration may occur via transcription of the repeats into inherently toxic repetitive sense and antisense RNA species, or via repeat-associated non-ATG initiated translation (RANT) of sense and antisense RNA into toxic dipeptide repeat proteins. We have previously demonstrated that regular interspersion of repeat RNA with stop codons prevents RANT (RNA-only models), allowing us to study the role of repeat RNA in isolation. Here we have created novel RNA-only Drosophila models, including the first models of antisense repeat toxicity, and flies expressing extremely large repeats, within the range observed in patients. We generated flies expressing ~ 100 repeat sense or antisense RNA either as part of a processed polyadenylated transcript or intronic sequence. We additionally created Drosophila expressing > 1000 RNA-only repeats in the sense direction. When expressed in adult Drosophila neurons polyadenylated repeat RNA is largely cytoplasmic in localisation, whilst intronic repeat RNA forms intranuclear RNA foci, as does > 1000 repeat RNA, thus allowing us to investigate both nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA toxicity. We confirmed that these RNA foci are capable of sequestering endogenous Drosophila RNA-binding proteins, and that the production of dipeptide proteins (poly-glycine-proline, and poly-glycine-arginine) is suppressed in our models. We find that neither cytoplasmic nor nuclear sense or antisense RNA are toxic when expressed in adult Drosophila neurons, suggesting they have a limited role in disease pathogenesis.

%X The conserved and essential histone chaperone, facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT), reorganizes nucleosomes during DNA transcription, replication, and repair and ensures both efficient elongation of RNA Pol II and nucleosome integrity. In mammalian cells, FACT is a heterodimer, consisting of SSRP1 and SUPT16. Here, we show that in contrast to yeast, FACT accumulates at the transcription start site of genes reminiscent of RNA polymerase II profile. Depletion of FACT in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to deregulation of developmental and pro-proliferative genes concomitant with hyper-proliferation of mES cells. Using MNase-seq, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing, and nascent elongating transcript sequencing, we show that up-regulation of genes coincides with loss of nucleosomes upstream of the transcription start site and concomitant increase in antisense transcription, indicating that FACT impacts the promoter architecture to regulate the expression of these genes. Finally, we demonstrate a role for FACT in cell fate determination and show that FACT depletion primes embryonic stem cells for the neuronal lineage.

%X How mtDNA replication is terminated and the newly formed genomes are separated remain unknown. We here demonstrate that the mitochondrial isoform of topoisomerase 3alpha (Top3alpha) fulfills this function, acting independently of its nuclear role as a component of the Holliday junction-resolving BLM-Top3alpha-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex. Our data indicate that mtDNA replication termination occurs via a hemicatenane formed at the origin of H-strand replication and that Top3alpha is essential for resolving this structure. Decatenation is a prerequisite for separation of the segregating unit of mtDNA, the nucleoid, within the mitochondrial network. The importance of this process is highlighted in a patient with mitochondrial disease caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in TOP3A, characterized by muscle-restricted mtDNA deletions and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) plus syndrome. Our work establishes Top3alpha as an essential component of the mtDNA replication machinery and as the first component of the mtDNA separation machinery.

%X PARPs are a family of enzymes that synthesise ADP-ribosylation (ADPr), a reversible modification of proteins that regulates many different cellular processes. Several mammalian PARPs are known to regulate the DNA damage response, but it is not clear which amino acids in proteins are the primary ADPr targets. Previously we reported that ARH3 reverses the newly discovered type of ADPr (ADPr on serine residues; Ser-ADPr) and developed tools to analyse this modification (Fontana et al, 2017). Here we show that Ser-ADPr represents the major fraction of ADPr synthesised after DNA damage in mammalian cells and that globally Ser-ADPr is dependent on HPF1, PARP1 and ARH3. In the absence of HPF1, glutamate/aspartate become the main target residues for ADPr. Furthermore, we describe a method for site-specific validation of serine ADP-ribosylated substrates in cells. Our study establishes serine as the primary form of ADPr in DNA damage signalling.

%X Longer human lives have led to a global burden of late-life disease. However, some older people experience little ill health, a trait that should be extended to the general population. Interventions into lifestyle, including increased exercise and reduction in food intake and obesity, can help to maintain healthspan. Altered gut microbiota, removal of senescent cells, blood factors obtained from young individuals and drugs can all improve late-life health in animals. Application to humans will require better biomarkers of disease risk and responses to interventions, closer alignment of work in animals and humans, and increased use of electronic health records, biobank resources and cohort studies.

%X The function of mitochondria depends on ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary conserved m-AAA proteases in the inner membrane. These ATP-dependent peptidases form hexameric complexes built up of homologous subunits. AFG3L2 subunits assemble either into homo-oligomeric isoenzymes or with SPG7 (paraplegin) subunits into hetero-oligomeric proteolytic complexes. Mutations in AFG3L2 are associated with dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA28) characterized by the loss of Purkinje cells, whereas mutations in SPG7 cause a recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP7) with motor neurons of the cortico-spinal tract being predominantly affected. Pleiotropic functions have been assigned to m-AAA proteases, which act as quality control and regulatory enzymes in mitochondria. Loss of m-AAA proteases affects mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiration and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and deficiencies in the axonal transport of mitochondria. Moreover m-AAA proteases regulate the assembly of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. Impaired degradation of the MCU subunit EMRE in AFG3L2-deficient mitochondria results in the formation of deregulated MCU complexes, increased mitochondrial calcium uptake and increased vulnerability of neurons for calcium-induced cell death. A reduction of calcium influx into the cytosol of Purkinje cells rescues ataxia in an AFG3L2-deficient mouse model. In this review, we discuss the relationship between the m-AAA protease and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and its relevance for neurodegeneration and describe a novel mouse model lacking MCU specifically in Purkinje cells. Our results pledge for a novel view on m-AAA proteases that integrates their pleiotropic functions in mitochondria to explain the pathogenesis of associated neurodegenerative disorders.

%X The regulation of mitochondrial RNA life cycles and their roles in ribosome biogenesis and energy metabolism are not fully understood. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate heart- and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout mice of the pentatricopeptide repeat domain protein 1, PTCD1, and show that its loss leads to severe cardiomyopathy and premature death. Our detailed transcriptome-wide and functional analyses of these mice enabled us to identify the molecular role of PTCD1 as a 16S rRNA-binding protein essential for its stability, pseudouridylation, and correct biogenesis of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit. We show that impaired mitoribosome biogenesis can have retrograde signaling effects on nuclear gene expression through the transcriptional activation of the mTOR pathway and upregulation of cytoplasmic protein synthesis and pro-survival factors in the absence of mitochondrial translation. Taken together, our data show that impaired assembly of the mitoribosome exerts its consequences via differential regulation of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic protein synthesis.

%X How intracellular pathogens acquire essential non-diffusible host metabolites and whether the host cell counteracts the siphoning of these nutrients by its invaders are open questions. Here we show that host mitochondria fuse during infection by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii to limit its uptake of fatty acids (FAs). A combination of genetics and imaging of FA trafficking indicates that Toxoplasma infection triggers lipophagy, the autophagy of host lipid droplets (LDs), to secure cellular FAs essential for its proliferation. Indeed, Toxoplasma FA siphoning and growth are reduced in host cells genetically deficient for autophagy or triglyceride depots. Conversely, Toxoplasma FA uptake and proliferation are increased in host cells lacking mitochondrial fusion, required for efficient mitochondrial FA oxidation, or where mitochondrial FA oxidation is pharmacologically inhibited. Thus, mitochondrial fusion can be regarded as a cellular defense mechanism against intracellular parasites, by limiting Toxoplasma access to host nutrients liberated by lipophagy.

%X The identification of initial lead conditions for successful protein crystallization is crucial for structural studies using X-ray crystallography. In order to reduce the number of false-negative conditions, an emerging number of fluorescence-based methods have been developed which allow more efficient identification of protein crystals and help to distinguish them from salt crystals. Detection of the native tryptophan fluorescence of protein crystals is one of the most widely used methods. However, this method can fail owing to the properties of the crystallized protein or the chemical composition of the crystallization trials. Here, a simple, fast and cost-efficient method employing 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) has been developed. It can be performed with a standard UV-light microscope and can be applied to cases in which detection of native tryptophan fluorescence fails. In four test cases this method had no effect on the diffraction properties of the crystals and no structural changes were observed. Further evidence is provided that TCE can be added to crystallization trials during their preparation, making this method compatible with high-throughput approaches.

%X Cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes are crucial to couple intercellular adhesion to the actin or intermediate filament cytoskeletons, respectively. As such, these intercellular junctions are essential to provide not only integrity to epithelia and other tissues but also the mechanical machinery necessary to execute complex morphogenetic and homeostatic intercellular rearrangements. Moreover, these spatially defined junctions serve as signaling hubs that integrate mechanical and chemical pathways to coordinate tissue architecture with behavior. This review takes an evolutionary perspective on how the emergence of these two essential intercellular junctions at key points during the evolution of multicellular animals afforded metazoans with new opportunities to integrate adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and signaling. We discuss known literature on cross-talk between the two junctions and, using the skin epidermis as an example, provide a model for how these two junctions function in concert to orchestrate tissue organization and function.

%X Gut microbial communities participate in key aspects of host biology, including development, nutrient absorption, immunity and disease. During host ageing, intestinal microbes undergo dramatic changes in composition and function and can shift from commensal to pathogenic. However, whether they play a causal role in host ageing and life span has remained an open question for a long time. Recent work in model organisms has revealed for the first time that gut microbes can modulate ageing, opening new questions and opportunities to uncover novel ageing-modulating mechanisms and to design anti-ageing interventions by targeting the gut microbiota.

%X Defects in the respiratory chain, interfering with energy production in the cell, are major underlying causes of mitochondrial diseases. In spite of this, the surprising variety of clinical symptoms, disparity between ages of onset, as well as the involvement of mitochondrial impairment in ageing and age-related diseases continue to challenge our understanding of the pathogenic processes. This complexity can be in part attributed to the unique metabolic needs of organs or of various cell types. In this view, it remains essential to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction at the cellular level. For this purpose, we developed a novel enzyme histochemical method that enables precise quantification in fresh-frozen tissues using competing redox reactions which ultimately lead to the reduction of tetrazolium salts and formazan deposition in cytochrome c oxidase-deficient mitochondria. We demonstrate that the loss of oxidative activity is detected at very low levels - this achievement is unequalled by previous techniques and opens up new opportunities for the study of early disease processes or comparative investigations. Moreover, human biopsy samples of mitochondrial disease patients of diverse genotypic origins were used and the successful detection of COX-deficient cells suggests a broad application for this new method. Lastly, the assay can be adapted to a wide range of tissues in the mouse and extends to other animal models, which we show here with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Overall, the new assay provides the means to quantify and map, on a cell-by-cell basis, the full extent of COX deficiency in tissues, thereby expending new possibilities for future investigation.

%X DNA is typically found as a double helix, however it must be separated into single strands during all phases of DNA metabolism; including transcription, replication, recombination and repair. Although recent breakthroughs have enabled the design of modular RNA- and double-stranded DNA-binding proteins, there are currently no tools available to manipulate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Here we show that artificial pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins can be programmed for sequence-specific ssDNA binding. Interactions occur using the same code and specificity as for RNA binding. We solve the structures of DNA-bound and apo proteins revealing the basis for ssDNA binding and how hydrogen bond rearrangements enable the PPR structure to envelope its ssDNA target. Finally, we show that engineered PPRs can be designed to bind telomeric ssDNA and can block telomerase activity. The modular mode of ssDNA binding by PPR proteins provides tools to target ssDNA and to understand its importance in cells.

%X Disturbances in the morphology and function of mitochondria cause neurological diseases, which can affect the central and peripheral nervous system. The i-AAA protease YME1L ensures mitochondrial proteostasis and regulates mitochondrial dynamics by processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1. Mutations in YME1L cause a multi-systemic mitochondriopathy associated with neurological dysfunction and mitochondrial fragmentation but pathogenic mechanisms remained enigmatic. Here, we report on striking cell-type-specific defects in mice lacking YME1L in the nervous system. YME1L-deficient mice manifest ocular dysfunction with microphthalmia and cataracts and develop deficiencies in locomotor activity due to specific degeneration of spinal cord axons, which relay proprioceptive signals from the hind limbs to the cerebellum. Mitochondrial fragmentation occurs throughout the nervous system and does not correlate with the degenerative phenotype. Deletion of Oma1 restores tubular mitochondria but deteriorates axonal degeneration in the absence of YME1L, demonstrating that impaired mitochondrial proteostasis rather than mitochondrial fragmentation causes the observed neurological defects.

%X Localized control of cell death is crucial for the resistance of plants to pathogens. Papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) regulate plant defence to drive cell death and protection against biotrophic pathogens. In maize (Zea mays), PLCPs are crucial in the orchestration of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defence signalling. Despite this central role in immunity, it remains unknown how PLCPs are activated, and which downstream signals they induce to trigger plant immunity. Here, we discover an immune signalling peptide, Z. mays immune signalling peptide 1 (Zip1), which is produced after salicylic acid (SA) treatment. In vitro studies demonstrate that PLCPs are required to release bioactive Zip1 from its propeptide precursor. Conversely, Zip1 treatment strongly elicits SA accumulation in leaves. Moreover, transcriptome analyses revealed that Zip1 and SA induce highly overlapping transcriptional changes. Consequently, Zip1 promotes the infection of the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea, while it reduces virulence of the biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis. Thus, Zip1 represents the previously missing signal that is released by PLCPs to activate SA defence signalling.

%X Mitochondria are metabolic hubs that use multiple proteases to maintain proteostasis and to preserve their overall quality. A decline of mitochondrial proteolysis promotes cellular stress and may contribute to the aging process. Mitochondrial proteases have also emerged as tightly regulated enzymes required to support the remarkable mitochondrial plasticity necessary for metabolic adaptation in a number of physiological scenarios. Indeed, the mutation and dysfunction of several mitochondrial proteases can cause specific human diseases with severe metabolic phenotypes. Here, we present an overview of the proteolytic regulation of key mitochondrial functions such as respiration, lipid biosynthesis, and mitochondrial dynamics, all of which are required for metabolic control. We also pay attention to how mitochondrial proteases are acutely regulated in response to cellular stressors or changes in growth conditions, a greater understanding of which may one day uncover their therapeutic potential.

%X Cardiac dysfunctions dramatically increase with age. Revealing a currently unknown contributor to cardiac ageing, we report the age-dependent, cardiac-specific accumulation of the lysosphingolipid sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine, DHS) as an evolutionarily conserved hallmark of the aged vertebrate heart. Mechanistically, the DHS-derivative sphinganine-1-phosphate (DHS1P) directly inhibits HDAC1, causing an aberrant elevation in histone acetylation and transcription levels, leading to DNA damage. Accordingly, the pharmacological interventions, preventing (i) the accumulation of DHS1P using SPHK2 inhibitors, (ii) the aberrant increase in histone acetylation using histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors, (iii) the DHS1P-dependent increase in transcription using an RNA polymerase II inhibitor, block DHS-induced DNA damage in human cardiomyocytes. Importantly, an increase in DHS levels in the hearts of healthy young adult mice leads to an impairment in cardiac functionality indicated by a significant reduction in left ventricular fractional shortening and ejection fraction, mimicking the functional deterioration of aged hearts. These molecular and functional defects can be partially prevented in vivo using HAT inhibitors. Together, we report an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which increased DHS levels drive the decline in cardiac health.

%X Folic acid (FA) plays a vital role in central metabolism, including the one carbon cycle, nucleotide, and amino acid biosynthesis. The development of sensitive, accurate analytical methods to measure FA intermediates in tissues is critical to understand their biological roles in diverse physiological and pathological contexts. Here, we developed a highly sensitive method for the simultaneous quantification of FA intermediates in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to dissect metabolic networks. The method was further validated by analyzing the worm folate pool upon RNAi knockdown of the dihydrofolate reductase gene dhfr-1. Comparative mass spectrometry behavior of the FA analogs using two different ion sources, electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), revealed ESI-MS/MS to be more sensitive, but APCI-MS provided more detailed structure inferences, which can elucidate chemical investigation and synthesis of FA analogs. Finally, we report on the use of in vitro oxidation coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry as a tool to discover new endogenous FA derivatives in the nematode.

%X Mitochondria harbor specialized ribosomes (mitoribosomes) necessary for the synthesis of key membrane proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. To date, no animal model exists to study mitoribosome composition and mitochondrial translation coordination in mammals in vivo. Here, we create MitoRibo-Tag mice as a tool enabling affinity purification and proteomics analyses of mitoribosomes and their interactome in different tissues. We also define the composition of an assembly intermediate formed in the absence of MTERF4, necessary for a late step in mitoribosomal biogenesis. We identify the orphan protein PUSL1, which interacts with a large subunit assembly intermediate, and demonstrate that it is an inner-membrane-associated mitochondrial matrix protein required for efficient mitochondrial translation. This work establishes MitoRibo-Tag mice as a powerful tool to study mitoribosomes in vivo, enabling future studies on the mitoribosome interactome under different physiological states, as well as in disease and aging.

%X The importance of circadian biology has rarely been considered in pre-clinical studies, and even more when translating to the bedside. Circadian biology is becoming a critical factor for improving drug efficacy and diminishing drug toxicity. Indeed, there is emerging evidence showing that some drugs are more effective at nighttime than daytime, whereas for others it is the opposite. This suggests that the biology of the target cell will determine how an organ will respond to a drug at a specific time of the day, thus modulating pharmacodynamics. Thus, it is now time that circadian factors become an integral part of translational research.

%X OBJECTIVE: To explore genetic and lifestyle risk factors of MRI-defined brain infarcts (BI) in large population-based cohorts. METHODS: We performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and examined associations of vascular risk factors and their genetic risk scores (GRS) with MRI-defined BI and a subset of BI, namely, small subcortical BI (SSBI), in 18 population-based cohorts (n = 20,949) from 5 ethnicities (3,726 with BI, 2,021 with SSBI). Top loci were followed up in 7 population-based cohorts (n = 6,862; 1,483 with BI, 630 with SBBI), and we tested associations with related phenotypes including ischemic stroke and pathologically defined BI. RESULTS: The mean prevalence was 17.7% for BI and 10.5% for SSBI, steeply rising after age 65. Two loci showed genome-wide significant association with BI: FBN2, p = 1.77 x 10(-8); and LINC00539/ZDHHC20, p = 5.82 x 10(-9). Both have been associated with blood pressure (BP)-related phenotypes, but did not replicate in the smaller follow-up sample or show associations with related phenotypes. Age- and sex-adjusted associations with BI and SSBI were observed for BP traits (p value for BI, p [BI] = 9.38 x 10(-25); p [SSBI] = 5.23 x 10(-14) for hypertension), smoking (p [BI] = 4.4 x 10(-10); p [SSBI] = 1.2 x 10(-4)), diabetes (p [BI] = 1.7 x 10(-8); p [SSBI] = 2.8 x 10(-3)), previous cardiovascular disease (p [BI] = 1.0 x 10(-18); p [SSBI] = 2.3 x 10(-7)), stroke (p [BI] = 3.9 x 10(-69); p [SSBI] = 3.2 x 10(-24)), and MRI-defined white matter hyperintensity burden (p [BI] = 1.43 x 10(-157); p [SSBI] = 3.16 x 10(-106)), but not with body mass index or cholesterol. GRS of BP traits were associated with BI and SSBI (p </= 0.0022), without indication of directional pleiotropy. CONCLUSION: In this multiethnic GWAS meta-analysis, including over 20,000 population-based participants, we identified genetic risk loci for BI requiring validation once additional large datasets become available. High BP, including genetically determined, was the most significant modifiable, causal risk factor for BI.

%X Microglia are the brain-innate immune cells which actively surveil their environment and mediate multiple aspects of neuroinflammation, due to their ability to acquire diverse activation states and phenotypes. Simplified, M1-like microglia are defined as pro-inflammatory cells, while the alternative M2-like cells promote neuroprotection. The modulation of microglia polarization is an appealing neurotherapeutic strategy for stroke and other brain lesions, as well as neurodegenerative diseases. However, the activation profile and change of phenotype during experimental stroke is not well understood. With a combined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging approach and genetic targeting of two key genes of the M1- and M2-like phenotypes, iNOS and Ym1, we were able to monitor in vivo the dynamic adaption of the microglia phenotype in response to experimental stroke.

%X To uncover the selective forces shaping life-history trait evolution across species, we investigate the genomic basis underlying adaptations to seasonal habitat desiccation in African killifishes, identifying the genetic variants associated with positive and relaxed purifying selection in 45 killifish species and 231 wild individuals distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. In annual species, genetic drift led to the expansion of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and caused the accumulation of deleterious genetic variants in key life-history modulating genes such as mtor, insr, ampk, foxo3, and polg. Relaxation of purifying selection is also significantly associated with mitochondrial function and aging in human populations. We find that relaxation of purifying selection prominently shapes genomes and is a prime candidate force molding the evolution of lifespan and the distribution of genetic variants associated with late-onset diseases in different species.

%X MYC paralogs are frequently activated in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) but represent poor drug targets. Thus, a detailed mapping of MYC-paralog-specific vulnerabilities may help to develop effective therapies for SCLC patients. Using a unique cellular CRISPR activation model, we uncover that, in contrast to MYCN and MYCL, MYC represses BCL2 transcription via interaction with MIZ1 and DNMT3a. The resulting lack of BCL2 expression promotes sensitivity to cell cycle control inhibition and dependency on MCL1. Furthermore, MYC activation leads to heightened apoptotic priming, intrinsic genotoxic stress and susceptibility to DNA damage checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, combined AURK and CHK1 inhibition substantially prolongs the survival of mice bearing MYC-driven SCLC beyond that of combination chemotherapy. These analyses uncover MYC-paralog-specific regulation of the apoptotic machinery with implications for genotype-based selection of targeted therapeutics in SCLC patients.

%X RNA interference (RNAi) is a valuable technique to determine gene function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, RNAi can be achieved by feeding worms bacteria carrying a plasmid expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting a gene of interest. The most commonly used plasmid vector for this purpose is L4440. However, it has been noticed that sequences within L4440 may elicit unspecific effects. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of these effects and their mechanisms and describe new unexpected phenotypes uncovered by the administration of unspecific exogenous dsRNA. An example involves dsRNA produced by the multiple cloning site (MCS) of L4440, which shares complementary sequences with some widely used reporter vectors and induces partial transgene silencing via the canonical and antiviral RNAi pathway. Going beyond transgene silencing, we found that the reduced embryonic viability of mir-35-41(gk262) mutants is partially reversed by exogenous dsRNA via a mechanism that involves canonical RNAi. These results indicate cross-regulation between different small RNA pathways in C. elegans to regulate embryonic viability. Recognition of the possible unspecific effects elicited by RNAi vectors is important for rigorous interpretation of results from RNAi-based experiments.

%X Key discoveries in aging research have been made possible with the use of model organisms. Caenorhabditis elegans is a short-lived nematode that has become a well-established system to study aging. The practicality and powerful genetic manipulations associated with this metazoan have revolutionized our ability to understand how organisms age. 25 years after the publication of the discovery of the daf-2 gene as a genetic modifier of lifespan, C. elegans remains as relevant as ever in the quest to understand the process of aging. Nematode aging research has proven useful in identifying transcriptional regulators, small molecule signals, cellular mechanisms, epigenetic modifications associated with stress resistance and longevity, and lifespan-extending compounds. Here, we review recent discoveries and selected topics that have emerged in aging research using this incredible little worm.

%X Background: Annual killifishes are adapted to surviving and reproducing over alternating dry and wet seasons. During the dry season, all adults die and desiccation-resistant embryos remain encased in dry mud for months or years in a state of diapause where their development is halted in anticipation of the months that have to elapse before their habitats are flooded again. Embryonic development of annual killifishes deviates from canonical teleost development. Epiblast cells disperse during epiboly, and a "dispersed phase" precedes gastrulation. In addition, annual fish have the ability to enter diapause and block embryonic development at the dispersed phase (diapause I), mid-somitogenesis (diapause II) and the final phase of development (diapause III). Developmental transitions associated with diapause entry and exit can be linked with cell cycle events. Here we set to image this transition in living embryos. Results: To visibly explore cell cycle dynamics during killifish development in depth, we created a stable transgenic line in Nothobranchius furzeri that expresses two fluorescent reporters, one for the G1 phase and one for the S/G2 phases of the cell cycle, respectively (Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator, FUCCI). Using this tool, we observed that, during epiboly, epiblast cells progressively become quiescent and exit the cell cycle. All embryos transit through a phase where dispersed cells migrate, without showing any mitotic activity, possibly blocked in the G1 phase (diapause I). Thereafter, exit from diapause I is synchronous and cells enter directly into the S phase without transiting through G1. The developmental trajectories of embryos entering diapause and of those that continue to develop are different. In particular, embryos entering diapause have reduced growth along the medio-lateral axis. Finally, exit from diapause II is synchronous for all cells and is characterized by a burst of mitotic activity and growth along the medio-lateral axis such that, by the end of this phase, the morphology of the embryos is identical to that of direct-developing embryos. Conclusions: Our study reveals surprising levels of coordination of cellular dynamics during diapause and provides a reference framework for further developmental analyses of this remarkable developmental quiescent state.

%X Increasing human life expectancy has posed increasing challenges for healthcare systems. As people age, they become more susceptible to chronic diseases, with an increasing burden of multimorbidity, and the associated polypharmacy. Accumulating evidence from work with laboratory animals has shown that ageing is a malleable process that can be ameliorated by genetic and environmental interventions. Drugs that modulate the ageing process may delay or even prevent the incidence of multiple diseases of ageing. To identify novel, anti-ageing drugs, several studies have developed computational drug-repurposing strategies. We review published studies showing the potential of current drugs to modulate ageing. Future studies should integrate current knowledge with multi-omics, health records, and drug safety data to predict drugs that can improve health in late life.

%X Heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations typically act in a recessive way and cause mitochondrial disease only if present above a certain threshold level. We have experimentally investigated to what extent the absolute levels of wild-type (WT) mtDNA influence disease manifestations by manipulating TFAM levels in mice with a heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation in the tRNA(Ala) gene. Increase of total mtDNA levels ameliorated pathology in multiple tissues, although the levels of heteroplasmy remained the same. A reduction in mtDNA levels worsened the phenotype in postmitotic tissues, such as heart, whereas there was an unexpected beneficial effect in rapidly proliferating tissues, such as colon, because of enhanced clonal expansion and selective elimination of mutated mtDNA. The absolute levels of WT mtDNA are thus an important determinant of the pathological manifestations, suggesting that pharmacological or gene therapy approaches to selectively increase mtDNA copy number provide a potential treatment strategy for human mtDNA mutation disease.

%X The dynamic interplay between metabolism and immune responses in health and disease, by which different immune cells impact on metabolic processes, are being increasingly appreciated. However, the potential of master regulators of metabolism to control innate immunity are less understood. Here, we studied the cross-talk between leptin signaling and macrophage function in the context of bacterial infections. We found that upon infection with Gram-negative pathogens, such as Salmonella Typhimurium, leptin receptor (Lepr) expression increased in both mouse and human macrophages. Unexpectedly, both genetic Lepr ablation in macrophages and global pharmacologic leptin antagonization augmented lysosomal functions, reduced S Typhimurium burden, and diminished inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that leptin induction activates the mTORC2/Akt pathway and subsequently down-regulates Phlpp1 phosphatase, allowing for phosphorylated Akt to impair lysosomal-mediated pathogen clearance. These data highlight a link between leptin signaling, the mTORC2/Phlpp1/Akt axis, and lysosomal activity in macrophages and have important therapeutic implications for modulating innate immunity to combat Gram-negative bacterial infections.

%X Advancing age is the dominant risk factor for most of the major killer diseases in developed countries. Hence, ameliorating the effects of ageing may prevent multiple diseases simultaneously. Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p < 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its HSP-90 target in Caenorhabditis elegans.

%X Maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence is critical for self-renewal and differentiation into mature lineages. Therefore, the ability to reliably detect abnormal HSC cycling is essential for experiments that seek to investigate abnormalities of HSC function. The ability to reproducibly evaluate cell cycle status in a rare cell subset requires careful optimization of multiple parameters during cell preparation and sample processing. Here, we describe a method where data acquisition parameters and fluorochrome combination for long-term HSC staining have been specifically designed for concurrent use with DAPI and Ki-67 antibodies.

%X In all biological systems, RNAs are associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), forming complexes that control gene regulatory mechanisms, from RNA synthesis to decay. In mammalian mitochondria, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is conducted by mitochondrial RBPs (mt-RBPs) at various stages of mt-RNA metabolism, including polycistronic transcript production, its processing into individual transcripts, mt-RNA modifications, stability, translation and degradation. To date, only a handful of mt-RBPs have been characterized. Here, we describe a putative human mitochondrial protein, C6orf203, that contains an S4-like domain-an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding domain previously identified in proteins involved in translation. Our data show C6orf203 to bind highly structured RNA in vitro and associate with the mitoribosomal large subunit in HEK293T cells. Knockout of C6orf203 leads to a decrease in mitochondrial translation and consequent OXPHOS deficiency, without affecting mitochondrial RNA levels. Although mitoribosome stability is not affected in C6orf203-depleted cells, mitoribosome profiling analysis revealed a global disruption of the association of mt-mRNAs with the mitoribosome, suggesting that C6orf203 may be required for the proper maturation and functioning of the mitoribosome. We therefore propose C6orf203 to be a novel RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial translation, expanding the repertoire of factors engaged in this process.

%X Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic pathway critical for stress responses and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Defective autophagy contributes to the etiology of an increasing number of diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. Cells have to integrate complex metabolic information in order to counteract metabolic challenges ranging from carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate to metal ion limitations. An unparalleled variety of cytoplasmic materials in size and nature can be transported into the lytic compartment for degradation and recycling by transient double-membrane compartments, termed autophagosomes, during macroautophagy. In this review, we will outline our current mechanistic understanding of how cells regulate the initiation of macroautophagy to target substrates nonselectively or selectively. With an emphasis on findings in the yeast system, we will describe the emerging principles underlying the regulation of autophagy substrate recognition, which critically shapes the scope of stress-adapted autophagy responses upon diverse metabolic challenges.

%X OBJECTIVE: Dietary restriction (DR) improves health and prolongs lifespan in part by upregulating type III endoribonuclease DICER in adipose tissue. In this study, we aimed to specifically test which missing dietary component was responsible for DICER upregulation. METHODS: We performed a nutrient screen in mouse preadipocytes and validated the results in vivo using different kinds of dietary interventions in wild type or genetically modified mice and worms, also testing the requirement of DICER on the effects of the diets. RESULTS: We found that sulfur amino acid restriction (i.e., methionine or cysteine) is sufficient to increase Dicer mRNA expression in preadipocytes. Consistently, while DR increases DICER expression in adipose tissue of mice, this effect is blunted by supplementation of the diet with methionine, cysteine, or casein, but not with a lipid or carbohydrate source. Accordingly, dietary methionine or protein restriction mirrors the effects of DR. These changes are associated with alterations in serum adiponectin. We also found that DICER controls and is controlled by adiponectin. In mice, DICER plays a role in methionine restriction-induced upregulation of Ucp1 in adipose tissue. In C. elegans, DR and a model of methionine restriction also promote DICER expression in the intestine (an analog of the adipose tissue) and prolong lifespan in a DICER-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: We propose an evolutionary conserved mechanism in which dietary sulfur amino acid restriction upregulates DICER levels in adipose tissue leading to beneficial health effects.

%X Microglia rapidly respond to changes in neural activity and inflammation to regulate synaptic connectivity. The extracellular signals, particularly neuron-derived molecules, that drive these microglial functions at synapses remain a key open question. Here we show that whisker lesioning, known to dampen cortical activity, induces microglia-mediated synapse elimination. This synapse elimination is dependent on signaling by CX3CR1, the receptor for microglial fractalkine (also known as CXCL1), but not complement receptor 3. Furthermore, mice deficient in CX3CL1 have profound defects in synapse elimination. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Cx3cl1 is derived from cortical neurons, and ADAM10, a metalloprotease that cleaves CX3CL1 into a secreted form, is upregulated specifically in layer IV neurons and in microglia following whisker lesioning. Finally, inhibition of ADAM10 phenocopies Cx3cr1(-/-) and Cx3cl1(-/-) synapse elimination defects. Together, these results identify neuron-to-microglia signaling necessary for cortical synaptic remodeling and reveal that context-dependent immune mechanisms are utilized to remodel synapses in the mammalian brain.

%X Ectopic lipid deposition and altered mitochondrial dynamics contribute to the development of obesity and insulin resistance. However, the mechanistic link between these processes remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the C16:0 sphingolipid synthesizing ceramide synthases, CerS5 and CerS6, affect distinct sphingolipid pools and that abrogation of CerS6 but not of CerS5 protects from obesity and insulin resistance. We identify proteins that specifically interact with C16:0 sphingolipids derived from CerS5 or CerS6. Here, only CerS6-derived C16:0 sphingolipids bind the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). CerS6 and Mff deficiency protect from fatty acid-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in vitro, and the two proteins genetically interact in vivo in obesity-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and development of insulin resistance. Our experiments reveal an unprecedented specificity of sphingolipid signaling depending on specific synthesizing enzymes, provide a mechanistic link between hepatic lipid deposition and mitochondrial fragmentation in obesity, and define the CerS6-derived sphingolipid/Mff interaction as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.

%X The steadily increasing throughput in next-generation sequencing technologies is revolutionizing a number of fields in biology. One application requiring massive parallel sequencing is forward genetic screening based on chemical mutagenesis. Such screens interrogate the entire genome in an entirely unbiased fashion and can be applied to a number of research questions. CRISPR/Cas9-based screens, which are largely limited to a gene's loss of function, have already been very successful in identifying drug targets and pathways related to the drug's mode of action. By inducing single nucleotide changes using an alkylating reagent, it is possible to generate amino acid changes that perturb the interaction between a drug and its direct target, resulting in drug resistance. This chemogenomic approach combined with latest sequencing technologies allows deconvolution of drug targets and characterization of drug-target binding interfaces at amino acid resolution, therefore nicely complementing existing biochemical approaches. Here we describe a general protocol for a chemical mutagenesis-based forward genetic screen applicable for drug-target deconvolution.

%X BACKGROUND: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are fundamental regulators of cellular biology that affect all steps in the generation and processing of RNA molecules. Recent evidence suggests that regulation of RBPs that modulate both RNA stability and translation may have a profound effect on the proteome. However, regulation of RBPs in clinically relevant experimental conditions has not been studied systematically. METHODS: We used RNA interactome capture, a method for the global identification of RBPs to characterize the global RNA-binding proteome (RBPome) associated with polyA-tailed RNA species in murine ciliated epithelial cells of the inner medullary collecting duct. To study regulation of RBPs in a clinically relevant condition, we analyzed hypoxia-associated changes of the RBPome. RESULTS: We identified >1000 RBPs that had been previously found using other systems. In addition, we found a number of novel RBPs not identified by previous screens using mouse or human cells, suggesting that these proteins may be specific RBPs in differentiated kidney epithelial cells. We also found quantitative differences in RBP-binding to mRNA that were associated with hypoxia versus normoxia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the regulation of RBPs through environmental stimuli and provide insight into the biology of hypoxia-response signaling in epithelial cells in the kidney. A repository of the RBPome and proteome in kidney tubular epithelial cells, derived from our findings, is freely accessible online, and may contribute to a better understanding of the role of RNA-protein interactions in kidney tubular epithelial cells, including the response of these cells to hypoxia.

%X Genomic instability can be a hallmark of both human genetic disease and cancer. We identify a deleterious UBQLN4 mutation in families with an autosomal recessive syndrome reminiscent of genome instability disorders. UBQLN4 deficiency leads to increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress and delayed DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. The proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN4 is phosphorylated by ATM and interacts with ubiquitylated MRE11 to mediate early steps of homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair (HRR). Loss of UBQLN4 leads to chromatin retention of MRE11, promoting non-physiological HRR activity in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, UBQLN4 overexpression represses HRR and favors non-homologous end joining. Moreover, we find UBQLN4 overexpressed in aggressive tumors. In line with an HRR defect in these tumors, UBQLN4 overexpression is associated with PARP1 inhibitor sensitivity. UBQLN4 therefore curtails HRR activity through removal of MRE11 from damaged chromatin and thus offers a therapeutic window for PARP1 inhibitor treatment in UBQLN4-overexpressing tumors.

%X Mutations in genes encoding components of the DNA damage response (DDR) are among the most frequent aberrations in human tumors. Moreover, a large array of human syndromes is caused by mutations in genes involved in DDR pathways. Among others, homologous recombination repair (HR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is frequently affected by disabling mutations. While impaired HR is clearly promoting tumorigenesis, it is also associated with an actionable sensitivity against PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors have recently received FDA approval for the treatment of breast- and ovarian cancer. However, as with all molecularly targeted agents, acquired resistance limits its use. Both pharmaco-genomic approaches and the study of human genome instability syndromes have led to a profound understanding of PARP inhibitor resistance. These experiments have revealed new insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive mammalian DSB repair. Here, we review recent discoveries in the field and provide a clinical perspective.

%X Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) promotes homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA double-strand break repair. It was recently shown that the proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN4 facilitates MRE11 degradation to repress HR. Surprisingly, the UBQLN4-MRE11 interaction is ATM-dependent, suggesting that the proximal DNA damage kinase ATM does not only initiate HR, but also limits excessive end resection.

%X Regulation of replication and expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is essential for cellular energy conversion via oxidative phosphorylation. The mitochondrial transcription elongation factor (TEFM) has been proposed to regulate the switch between transcription termination for replication primer formation and processive, near genome-length transcription for mtDNA gene expression. Here, we report that Tefm is essential for mouse embryogenesis and that levels of promoter-distal mitochondrial transcripts are drastically reduced in conditional Tefm-knockout hearts. In contrast, the promoter-proximal transcripts are much increased in Tefm knockout mice, but they mostly terminate before the region where the switch from transcription to replication occurs, and consequently, de novo mtDNA replication is profoundly reduced. Unexpectedly, deep sequencing of RNA from Tefm knockouts revealed accumulation of unprocessed transcripts in addition to defective transcription elongation. Furthermore, a proximity-labeling (BioID) assay showed that TEFM interacts with multiple RNA processing factors. Our data demonstrate that TEFM acts as a general transcription elongation factor, necessary for both gene transcription and replication primer formation, and loss of TEFM affects RNA processing in mammalian mitochondria.

%X Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been suggested to be particularly potent activators of Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling. Moreover, increased circulating BCAAs are associated with higher risk of insulin resistance and diabetes in both mice and humans, and with increased mortality in mice. However, it remains unknown if BCAAs play a more prominent role in longevity than do other essential amino acids (EAAs). To test for a more prominent role of BCAAs in lifespan and related traits in Drosophila, we restricted either BCAAs or a control group of three other EAAs, threonine, histidine and lysine (THK). BCAA restriction induced compensatory feeding, lipid accumulation, stress resistance and amelioration of age-related gut pathology. It also extended lifespan in a dietary-nitrogen-dependent manner. Importantly, the control restriction of THK had similar effects on these phenotypes. Our control diet was designed to have every EAA equally limiting for growth and reproduction, and our findings therefore suggest that the level of the most limiting EAAs in the diet, rather than the specific EAAs that are limiting, determines the response of these phenotypes to EAA restriction.

%X Divergent populations across different environments are exposed to critical sensory information related to locating a host or mate, as well as avoiding predators and pathogens. These sensory signals generate evolutionary changes in neuroanatomy and behavior; however, few studies have investigated patterns of neural architecture that occur between sensory systems, or that occur within large groups of closely-related organisms. Here we examine 62 species within the genus Drosophila and describe an inverse resource allocation between vision and olfaction, which we consistently observe at the periphery, within the brain, as well as during larval development. This sensory variation was noted across the entire genus and appears to represent repeated, independent evolutionary events, where one sensory modality is consistently selected for at the expense of the other. Moreover, we provide evidence of a developmental genetic constraint through the sharing of a single larval structure, the eye-antennal imaginal disc. In addition, we examine the ecological implications of visual or olfactory bias, including the potential impact on host-navigation and courtship.

%X Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with yet incompletely uncovered molecular determinants. Alterations in the abundance of low molecular weight compounds (metabolites) in ASD could add to our understanding of the disease. Indeed, such alterations take place in the urine, plasma and cerebellum of ASD individuals. In this work, we investigated mass-spectrometric signal intensities of 1,366 metabolites in the prefrontal cortex grey matter of 32 ASD and 40 control individuals. 15% of these metabolites showed significantly different intensities in ASD and clustered in 16 metabolic pathways. Of them, ten pathways were altered in urine and blood of ASD individuals (Fisher test, p < 0.05), opening an opportunity for the design of new diagnostic instruments. Furthermore, metabolic measurements conducted in 40 chimpanzees and 40 macaques showed an excess of metabolite intensity differences unique to humans, supporting the hypothesized disruption of evolutionary novel cortical mechanisms in ASD.

%X Whole-organism phenotypic assays are central to the assessment of neuromuscular function and health in model organisms such as the nematode C. elegans. In this study, we report a new assay format for engaging C. elegans in burrowing that enables rapid assessment of nematode neuromuscular health. In contrast to agar environments that pose specific drawbacks for characterization of C. elegans burrowing ability, here we use the optically transparent and biocompatible Pluronic F-127 gel that transitions from liquid to gel at room temperature, enabling convenient and safe handling of animals. The burrowing assay methodology involves loading animals at the bottom of well plates, casting a liquid-phase of Pluronic on top that solidifies via a modest temperature upshift, enticing animals to reach the surface via chemotaxis to food, and quantifying the relative success animals have in reaching the chemoattractant. We study the influence of Pluronic concentration, gel height and chemoattractant choice to optimize assay performance. To demonstrate the simplicity of the assay workflow and versatility, we show its novel application in multiple areas including (i) evaluating muscle mutants with defects in dense bodies and/or M-lines (pfn-3, atn-1, uig-1, dyc-1, zyx-1, unc-95 and tln-1), (ii) tuning assay conditions to reveal changes in the mutant gei-8, (iii) sorting of fast burrowers in a genetically-uniform wild-type population for later quantitation of their distinct muscle gene expression, and (iv) testing proteotoxic animal models of Huntington and Parkinson's disease. Results from our studies show that stimulating animals to navigate in a dense environment that offers mechanical resistance to three-dimensional locomotion challenges the neuromuscular system in a manner distinct from standard crawling and thrashing assays. Our simple and high throughput burrowing assay can provide insight into molecular mechanisms for maintenance of neuromuscular health and facilitate screening for therapeutic targets.

%X Reprogramming of mitochondria provides cells with the metabolic flexibility required to adapt to various developmental transitions such as stem cell activation or immune cell reprogramming, and to respond to environmental challenges such as those encountered under hypoxic conditions or during tumorigenesis(1-3). Here we show that the i-AAA protease YME1L rewires the proteome of pre-existing mitochondria in response to hypoxia or nutrient starvation. Inhibition of mTORC1 induces a lipid signalling cascade via the phosphatidic acid phosphatase LIPIN1, which decreases phosphatidylethanolamine levels in mitochondrial membranes and promotes proteolysis. YME1L degrades mitochondrial protein translocases, lipid transfer proteins and metabolic enzymes to acutely limit mitochondrial biogenesis and support cell growth. YME1L-mediated mitochondrial reshaping supports the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells as spheroids or xenografts. Similar changes to the mitochondrial proteome occur in the tumour tissues of patients with PDAC, suggesting that YME1L is relevant to the pathophysiology of these tumours. Our results identify the mTORC1-LIPIN1-YME1L axis as a post-translational regulator of mitochondrial proteostasis at the interface between metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics.

%X Derived from bacterial ancestors, mitochondria have maintained their own albeit strongly reduced genome, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes for a small and highly specialized set of genes. MtDNA exists in tens to thousands of copies packaged in numerous nucleoprotein complexes, termed nucleoids, distributed throughout the dynamic mitochondrial network. Our understanding of the mechanisms of how cells regulate the copy number of mitochondrial genomes has been limited. Here, we summarize and discuss our recent findings that Mip1/POLG (mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma) critically controls mtDNA copy number by operating in 2 opposing modes, synthesis and, unexpectedly, degradation of mtDNA, when yeast cells face nutrient starvation. The balance of the 2 modes of Mip1/POLG and thus mtDNA copy number dynamics depends on the integrity of macroautophagy/autophagy, which sustains continuous synthesis and maintenance of mtDNA. In autophagy-deficient cells, a combination of nucleotide insufficiency and elevated mitochondrial ROS production impairs mtDNA synthesis and drives mtDNA degradation by the 3'-5'-exonuclease activity of Mip1/POLG resulting in mitochondrial genome depletion and irreversible respiratory deficiency. Abbrivations: mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; mtDCN: mitochondrial DNA copy number.

%X CircRNAs are a subgroup of RNAs which form a circular molecule. During the splicing process the 3’ splice donor loops back to form a covalent bond with an upstream 5’ splice acceptor instead of the downstream 5’ acceptor. The majority of circRNAs are non-coding splice isoforms of protein coding genes showing tissue and time specific expression. Because circRNAs have no 5’ cap nor 3’ poly-A tail, they degrade slower than their linear host genes. Only few studies were able to show a specific function for circRNAs.In this work we sequenced 23 samples from three tissues (brain, muscle, and gut) at three (two for gut) time points throughout the life of the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri). We identified 1810 unique circRNAs, half of which are conserved with humans and mice. With this study we provide a comprehensive atlas to the circRNA landscape in the ageing African turquoise killifish, which serves as a novel resource to the circRNA as well as the ageing community.

%X Conserved lipid transfer proteins of the Ups/PRELI family regulate lipid accumulation in mitochondria by shuttling phospholipids in a lipid-specific manner across the intermembrane space. Here, we combine structural analysis, unbiased genetic approaches in yeast and molecular dynamics simulations to unravel determinants of lipid specificity within the conserved Ups/PRELI family. We present structures of human PRELID1-TRIAP1 and PRELID3b-TRIAP1 complexes, which exert lipid transfer activity for phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine, respectively. Reverse yeast genetic screens identify critical amino acid exchanges that broaden and swap their lipid specificities. We find that amino acids involved in head group recognition and the hydrophobicity of flexible loops regulate lipid entry into the binding cavity. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal different membrane orientations of PRELID1 and PRELID3b during the stepwise release of lipids. Our experiments thus define the structural determinants of lipid specificity and the dynamics of lipid interactions by Ups/PRELI proteins.

%X The skin epidermis is a constantly renewing stratified epithelium that provides essential protective barrier functions throughout life. Epidermal stratification is governed by a step-wise differentiation program that requires precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression. How epidermal self-renewal and differentiation are regulated remains a fundamental open question. Cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms that modify chromatin structure and interactions have been identified as key regulators of epidermal differentiation and stratification. Here, we will review the recent advances in our understanding of how chromatin modifiers, tissue-specific transcription factors, and force-induced nuclear remodeling processes function to shape chromatin and to control epidermal tissue development and homeostasis.

%X Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an emerging class of RNA molecules that have been linked to human diseases and important regulatory pathways. Their functional roles are still under investigation, often hampered by inefficient circRNA formation in and ex vivo. We generated an intron-mediated enhancement (IME) system that-in comparison to previously published methods-increases circRNA formation up to 5-fold. This strategy also revealed previously undetected translation of circRNA, e.g., circRtn4. Substantiated by Western blots and mass spectrometry we showed that in mammalian cells, translation of circRtn4 containing a potential "infinite" circular reading frame resulted in "monomers" and extended proteins, presumably "multimer" tandem repeats. In order to achieve high levels of circRNA formation and translation of other natural or recombinant circRNAs, we constructed a versatile circRNA expression vector-pCircRNA-DMo. We demonstrated the general applicability of this method by efficiently generating two additional circRNAs exhibiting high expression levels. The circRNA expression vector will be an important tool to investigate different aspects of circRNA biogenesis and to gain insights into mechanisms of circular RNA translation.

%X A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion within the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Sense and antisense repeat-containing transcripts undergo repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated translation to produce five dipeptide proteins (DPRs). The polyGR and polyPR DPRs are extremely toxic when expressed in Drosophila neurons. To determine the mechanism that mediates this toxicity, we purified DPRs from the Drosophila brain and used mass spectrometry to identify the in vivo neuronal DPR interactome. PolyGR and polyPR interact with ribosomal proteins, and inhibit translation in both human iPSC-derived motor neurons, and adult Drosophila neurons. We next performed a screen of 81 translation-associated proteins in GGGGCC repeat-expressing Drosophila to determine whether this translational repression can be overcome and if this impacts neurodegeneration. Expression of the translation initiation factor eIF1A uniquely rescued DPR-induced toxicity in vivo, indicating that restoring translation is a potential therapeutic strategy. These data directly implicate translational repression in C9orf72 repeat-induced neurodegeneration and identify eIF1A as a novel modifier of C9orf72 repeat toxicity.

%X Hexanucleotide repeat expansions of variable size in C9orf72 are the most prevalent genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Sense and antisense transcripts of the expansions are translated by repeat-associated non-AUG translation into five dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Of these, the polyGR, polyPR and, to a lesser extent, polyGA DPRs are neurotoxic, with polyGA the most abundantly detected DPR in patient tissue. Trans-cellular transmission of protein aggregates has recently emerged as a major driver of toxicity in various neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro evidence suggests that the C9 DPRs can spread. However, whether this phenomenon occurs under more complex in vivo conditions remains unexplored. Here, we used the adult fly brain to investigate whether the C9 DPRs can spread in vivo upon expression in a subset of neurons. We found that only polyGA can progressively spread throughout the brain, which accumulates in the shape of aggregate-like puncta inside recipient cells. Interestingly, GA transmission occurred as early as 3 days after expression induction. By comparing the spread of 36, 100 and 200 polyGA repeats, we found that polyGA spread is enhanced upon expression of longer GA DPRs. Transmission of polyGA is greater in older flies, indicating that age-associated factors exacerbate the spread. These data highlight a unique propensity of polyGA to spread throughout the brain, which could contribute to the greater abundance of polyGA in patient tissue. In addition, we present a model of early GA transmission that is suitable for genetic screens to identify mechanisms of spread and its consequences in vivo.

%X Mitochondrial dysfunction causes neurodegeneration but whether impairment of mitochondrial homeostasis in astrocytes contributes to this pathological process remains largely unknown. The m-AAA protease exerts quality control and regulatory functions crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis. AFG3L2, which encodes one of the subunits of the m-AAA protease, is mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia SCA28 and in infantile syndromes characterized by spastic-ataxia, epilepsy and premature death. Here, we investigate the role of Afg3l2 and its redundant homologue Afg3l1 in the Bergmann glia (BG), radial astrocytes of the cerebellum that have functional connections with Purkinje cells (PC) and regulate glutamate homeostasis. We show that astrocyte-specific deletion of Afg3l2 in the mouse leads to late-onset motor impairment and to degeneration of BG, which display aberrant morphology, altered expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2, and a reactive inflammatory signature. The neurological and glial phenotypes are drastically exacerbated when astrocytes lack both Afg31l and Afg3l2, and therefore, are totally depleted of the m-AAA protease. Moreover, mitochondrial stress responses and necroptotic markers are induced in the cerebellum. In both mouse models, targeted BG show a fragmented mitochondrial network and loss of mitochondrial cristae, but no signs of respiratory dysfunction. Importantly, astrocyte-specific deficiency of Afg3l1 and Afg3l2 triggers secondary morphological degeneration and electrophysiological changes in PCs, thus demonstrating a non-cell-autonomous role of glia in neurodegeneration. We propose that astrocyte dysfunction amplifies both neuroinflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity in patients carrying mutations in AFG3L2, leading to a vicious circle that contributes to neuronal death.

%X The advent of quantitative approaches that enable interrogation of transcription at single nucleotide resolution has allowed a novel understanding of transcriptional regulation previously undefined. However, little is known, at such high resolution, how transcription factors directly influence RNA Pol II pausing and directionality. To map the impact of transcription/elongation factors on transcription dynamics genome-wide at base pair resolution, we developed an adapted NET-seq protocol called NET-prism (Native Elongating Transcription by Polymerase-Regulated Immunoprecipitants in the Mammalian genome). Application of NET-prism on elongation factors (Spt6, Ssrp1), splicing factors (Sf1), and components of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (TFIID, and Mediator) reveals their inherent command on transcription dynamics, with regards to directionality and pausing over promoters, splice sites, and enhancers/super-enhancers. NET-prism will be broadly applicable as it exposes transcription factor/Pol II dependent topographic specificity and thus, a new degree of regulatory complexity during gene expression.

%X Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic degradation system, has been implicated as a convergent mechanism in various longevity pathways. Autophagic activity decreases with age in several organisms, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that the expression of Rubicon, a negative regulator of autophagy, increases in aged worm, fly and mouse tissues at transcript and/or protein levels, suggesting that an age-dependent increase in Rubicon impairs autophagy over time, and thereby curtails animal healthspan. Consistent with this idea, knockdown of Rubicon extends worm and fly lifespan and ameliorates several age-associated phenotypes. Tissue-specific experiments reveal that Rubicon knockdown in neurons has the greatest effect on lifespan. Rubicon knockout mice exhibits reductions in interstitial fibrosis in kidney and reduced alpha-synuclein accumulation in the brain. Rubicon is suppressed in several long-lived worms and calorie restricted mice. Taken together, our results suggest that suppression of autophagic activity by Rubicon is one of signatures of aging.

%X Oligoribonucleases are conserved enzymes that degrade short RNA molecules of up to 5 nt in length and are assumed to constitute the final stage of RNA turnover. Here we demonstrate that REXO2 is a specialized dinucleotide-degrading enzyme that shows no preference between RNA and DNA dinucleotide substrates. A heart- and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout mouse displays elevated dinucleotide levels and alterations in gene expression patterns indicative of aberrant dinucleotide-primed transcription initiation. We find that dinucleotides act as potent stimulators of mitochondrial transcription initiation in vitro. Our data demonstrate that increased levels of dinucleotides can be used to initiate transcription, leading to an increase in transcription levels from both mitochondrial promoters and other, nonspecific sequence elements in mitochondrial DNA. Efficient RNA turnover by REXO2 is thus required to maintain promoter specificity and proper regulation of transcription in mammalian mitochondria.

%X Cellular heterogeneity is an important contributor to biological function and is employed by cells, tissues and organisms to adapt, compensate, respond, defend and/or regulate specific processes. Research over the last decades has revealed that transcriptional noise is a major driver for cell-to-cell variability. In this review we will discuss sources of transcriptional variability, in particular bursting of gene expression and how it could contribute to cellular states and fate decisions. We will highlight recent developments in single cell sequencing technologies that make it possible to address cellular heterogeneity in unprecedented detail. Finally, we will review recent literature, in which these new technologies are harnessed to address pressing questions in the field of ageing research, such as transcriptional noise and cellular heterogeneity in the course of ageing.

%X Mitochondria are unique organelles harboring two distinct membranes, the mitochondrial inner and outer membrane (MIM and MOM, respectively). Mitochondria comprise only a subset of metabolic pathways for the synthesis of membrane lipids; therefore most lipid species and their precursors have to be imported from other cellular compartments. One such import process is mediated by the ER mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) complex. Both mitochondrial membranes surround the hydrophilic intermembrane space (IMS). Therefore, additional systems are required that shuttle lipids between the MIM and MOM. Recently, we identified the IMS protein Mcp2 as a high-copy suppressor for cells that lack a functional ERMES complex. To understand better how mitochondria facilitate transport and biogenesis of lipids, we searched for genetic interactions of this suppressor. We found that MCP2 has a negative genetic interaction with the gene TGL2 encoding a neutral lipid hydrolase. We show that this lipase is located in the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion and is imported via the Mia40 disulfide relay system. Furthermore, we show a positive genetic interaction of double deletion of MCP2 and PSD1, the gene encoding the enzyme that synthesizes the major amount of cellular phosphatidylethanolamine. Finally, we demonstrate that the nucleotide-binding motifs of the predicted atypical kinase Mcp2 are required for its proper function. Taken together, our data suggest that Mcp2 is involved in mitochondrial lipid metabolism and an increase of this involvement by overexpression suppresses loss of ERMES.

We describe Cytoscape Automation (CA), which marries Cytoscape to highly productive workflow systems, for example, Python/R in Jupyter/RStudio. We expose over 270 Cytoscape core functions and 34 Cytoscape apps as REST-callable functions with standardized JSON interfaces backed by Swagger documentation. Independent projects to create and publish Python/R native CA interface libraries have reached an advanced stage, and a number of automation workflows are already published.

%X Cancer cells acquire unlimited proliferative capacity by either re-expressing telomerase or inducing alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), which relies on telomere recombination. Here, we show that ALT recombination requires coordinate regulation of the SMX and BTR complexes to ensure the appropriate balance of resolution and dissolution activities at recombining telomeres. Critical to this control is SLX4IP, which accumulates at ALT telomeres and interacts with SLX4, XPF, and BLM. Loss of SLX4IP increases ALT-related phenotypes, which is incompatible with cell growth following concomitant loss of SLX4. Inactivation of BLM is sufficient to rescue telomere aggregation and the synthetic growth defect in this context, suggesting that SLX4IP favors SMX-dependent resolution by antagonizing promiscuous BLM activity during ALT recombination. Finally, we show that SLX4IP is inactivated in a subset of ALT-positive osteosarcomas. Collectively, our findings uncover an SLX4IP-dependent regulatory mechanism critical for telomere maintenance in ALT cancer cells.

%X Mitochondria play many important biological roles, including ATP production, lipid biogenesis, ROS regulation, and calcium clearance. In neurons, the mitochondrion is an essential organelle for metabolism and calcium homeostasis. Moreover, mitochondria are extremely dynamic and able to divide, fuse, and move along microtubule tracks to ensure their distribution to the neuronal periphery. Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered mitochondrial dynamics are observed in a wide range of conditions, from impaired neuronal development to various neurodegenerative diseases. Novel imaging techniques and genetic tools provide unprecedented access to the physiological roles of mitochondria by visualizing mitochondrial trafficking, morphological dynamics, ATP generation, and ultrastructure. Recent studies using these new techniques have unveiled the influence of mitochondria on axon branching, synaptic function, calcium regulation with the ER, glial cell function, neurogenesis, and neuronal repair. This review provides an overview of the crucial roles played by mitochondria in the CNS in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

%X The mitochondrial presequence translocation machinery (TIM23 complex) is conserved between the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans; however, functional characterization has been mainly performed in yeast. Here, we define the constituents of the human TIM23 complex using mass spectrometry and identified ROMO1 as a new translocase constituent with an exceptionally short half-life. Analyses of a ROMO1 knockout cell line revealed aberrant inner membrane structure and altered processing of the GTPase OPA1. We show that in the absence of ROMO1, mitochondria lose the inner membrane YME1L protease, which participates in OPA1 processing and ROMO1 turnover. While ROMO1 is dispensable for general protein import along the presequence pathway, we show that it participates in the dynamics of TIM21 during respiratory chain biogenesis and is specifically required for import of YME1L. This selective import defect can be linked to charge distribution in the unusually long targeting sequence of YME1L. Our analyses establish an unexpected link between mitochondrial protein import and inner membrane protein quality control.

%X Mitochondria have a compartmentalized gene expression system dedicated to the synthesis of membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Responsive quality control mechanisms are needed to ensure that aberrant protein synthesis does not disrupt mitochondrial function. Pathogenic mutations that impede the function of the mitochondrial matrix quality control protease complex composed of AFG3L2 and paraplegin cause a multifaceted clinical syndrome. At the cell and molecular level, defects to this quality control complex are defined by impairment to mitochondrial form and function. Here, we establish the etiology of these phenotypes. We show how disruptions to the quality control of mitochondrial protein synthesis trigger a sequential stress response characterized first by OMA1 activation followed by loss of mitochondrial ribosomes and by remodelling of mitochondrial inner membrane ultrastructure. Inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis with chloramphenicol completely blocks this stress response. Together, our data establish a mechanism linking major cell biological phenotypes of AFG3L2 pathogenesis and show how modulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis can exert a beneficial effect on organelle homeostasis.

%X Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, translating into an elongated polyglutamine stretch. In addition to the neurotoxic mutant HTT protein, the mutant CAG repeat RNA can exert toxic functions by trapping RNA-binding proteins. While few examples of proteins that aberrantly bind to mutant HTT RNA and execute abnormal function in conjunction with the CAG repeat RNA have been described, an unbiased approach to identify the interactome of mutant HTT RNA is missing. Here, we describe the analysis of proteins that preferentially bind mutant HTT RNA using a mass spectrometry approach. We show that (I) the majority of proteins captured by mutant HTT RNA belong to the spliceosome pathway, (II) expression of mutant CAG repeat RNA induces mis-splicing in a HD cell model, (III) overexpression of one of the splice factors trapped by mutant HTT ameliorates the HD phenotype in a fly model and (VI) deregulated splicing occurs in human HD brain. Our data suggest that deregulated splicing is a prominent mechanism of RNA-induced toxicity in HD.

%X Mitochondrial dynamics is an essential physiological process controlling mitochondrial content mixing and mobility to ensure proper function and localization of mitochondria at intracellular sites of high-energy demand. Intriguingly, for yet unknown reasons, severe impairment of mitochondrial fusion drastically affects mtDNA copy number. To decipher the link between mitochondrial dynamics and mtDNA maintenance, we studied mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and mouse cardiomyocytes with disruption of mitochondrial fusion. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that loss of outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) fusion, but not inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) fusion, leads to nucleoid clustering. Remarkably, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), bromouridine labeling in MEFs and assessment of mitochondrial transcription in tissue homogenates revealed that abolished OMM fusion does not affect transcription. Furthermore, the profound mtDNA depletion in mouse hearts lacking OMM fusion is not caused by defective integrity or increased mutagenesis of mtDNA, but instead we show that mitochondrial fusion is necessary to maintain the stoichiometry of the protein components of the mtDNA replisome. OMM fusion is necessary for proliferating MEFs to recover from mtDNA depletion and for the marked increase of mtDNA copy number during postnatal heart development. Our findings thus link OMM fusion to replication and distribution of mtDNA.

%X Elevated branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA per se or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.

%X Mitochondrial morphology is a crucial determinant of mitochondrial and cellular function. Opposing fusion and fission events shape the tubular mitochondrial reticulum and ensure mitochondrial transport within cells. Cellular stress and pathophysiological conditions can lead to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, which facilitates mitophagy and is associated with cell death. However, mitochondrial shape changes are also intertwined with the cellular metabolism, and metabolic switches can induce but also result from alterations in mitochondrial morphology. Here, we discuss recent advances in the field of mitochondrial dynamics, demonstrating cell- and tissue-specific effects of mitochondrial fragmentation on cellular metabolism, cell survival, and mitochondrial quality control.

%X Human populations, despite their overwhelming similarity, contain some distinct phenotypic, genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression features. In this study, we explore population differences at yet another level of molecular phenotype: the abundance of non-polar and polar low molecular weight compounds, lipids and metabolites in the prefrontal cortical region of the brain. We assessed the abundance of 1,670 lipids and 258 metabolites in 146 Han Chinese, 97 Western European, and 60 African American individuals of varying ages, covering most of the lifespan. The statistical analysis and logistic regression models both demonstrated extensive lipid and metabolic divergence of the Han Chinese individuals from the other two populations. This divergence was age-dependent, peaking in young adults, and involved metabolites and lipids clustering in specific metabolic pathways.

%X Survival to extreme ages clusters within families. However, identifying genetic loci conferring longevity and low morbidity in such longevous families is challenging. There is debate concerning the survival percentile that best isolates the genetic component in longevity. Here, we use three-generational mortality data from two large datasets, UPDB (US) and LINKS (Netherlands). We study 20,360 unselected families containing index persons, their parents, siblings, spouses, and children, comprising 314,819 individuals. Our analyses provide strong evidence that longevity is transmitted as a quantitative genetic trait among survivors up to the top 10% of their birth cohort. We subsequently show a survival advantage, mounting to 31%, for individuals with top 10% surviving first and second-degree relatives in both databases and across generations, even in the presence of non-longevous parents. To guide future genetic studies, we suggest to base case selection on top 10% survivors of their birth cohort with equally long-lived family members.

%X Cellular senescence has been shown to contribute to skin ageing. However, the role of melanocytes in the process is understudied. Our data show that melanocytes are the only epidermal cell type to express the senescence marker p16(INK4A) during human skin ageing. Aged melanocytes also display additional markers of senescence such as reduced HMGB1 and dysfunctional telomeres, without detectable telomere shortening. Additionally, senescent melanocyte SASP induces telomere dysfunction in paracrine manner and limits proliferation of surrounding cells via activation of CXCR3-dependent mitochondrial ROS. Finally, senescent melanocytes impair basal keratinocyte proliferation and contribute to epidermal atrophy in vitro using 3D human epidermal equivalents. Crucially, clearance of senescent melanocytes using the senolytic drug ABT737 or treatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ suppressed this effect. In conclusion, our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent melanocytes affect keratinocyte function and act as drivers of human skin ageing.

%X Understanding the individual timeline of stem cell differentiation in vivo is critical for evaluating stem cell properties in animal models. However, with conventional ex vivo techniques, such as histology, the individual timeline of differentiation is not accessible. Therefore, we designed lentiviral plasmids with cell-specific promoters to control the expression of bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging reporters. Promoter-dependent reporter expression in transduced human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) was an effective indicator of differentiation in cell culture. A 12-week in vivo imaging observation period revealed the time profile of differentiation of engrafted hNPCs in the mouse brain into astrocytes and mature neurons which was verified by immunostainings, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. The lentiviral vectors validated in this study provide an efficient imaging toolbox for non-invasive and longitudinal characterization of stem cell differentiation, in vitro screenings, and in vivo studies of cell therapy in animal models.

%X Plant innate immunity restricts growth of bacterial pathogens that threaten global food security. However, the mechanisms by which plant immunity suppresses bacterial growth remain enigmatic. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana secreted aspartic protease 1 and 2 (SAP1 and SAP2) cleave the evolutionarily conserved bacterial protein MucD to redundantly inhibit the growth of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Antibacterial activity of SAP1 requires its protease activity in planta and in vitro. Plants overexpressing SAP1 exhibit enhanced MucD cleavage and resistance but incur no penalties in growth and reproduction, while sap1 sap2 double mutant plants exhibit compromised MucD cleavage and resistance against P. syringae. P. syringae lacking mucD shows compromised growth in planta and in vitro. Notably, growth of ΔmucD complemented with the non-cleavable MucD(F106Y) is not affected by SAP activity in planta and in vitro. Our findings identify the genetic factors and biochemical process underlying an antibacterial mechanism in plants.

We used small RNA sequencing to identify tissue-specific miRNAs in the adult brain, thorax, gut, and fat body of Drosophila melanogaster One of the most brain-specific miRNAs that we identified was miR-210, an evolutionarily highly conserved miRNA implicated in the regulation of hypoxia in mammals. In Drosophila, we show that miR-210 is specifically expressed in sensory organs, including photoreceptors. miR-210 knockout mutants are not sensitive toward hypoxia but show progressive degradation of photoreceptor cells, accompanied by decreased photoreceptor potential, demonstrating an important function of miR-210 in photoreceptor maintenance and survival.

Here we establish a computational method, MitoSAlt, for accurate identification, quantification and visualization of mtDNA deletions and duplications from genomic sequencing data. Our method was tested on simulated sequencing reads and human patient samples with single deletions and duplications to verify its accuracy. Application to mouse models of mtDNA maintenance disease demonstrated the ability to detect deletions and duplications even at low levels of heteroplasmy.

%X A subset of patients with advanced-stage classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) relapse or progress following standard treatment. Given their dismal prognosis, identifying this group of patients upfront represents an important medical need. While prior research has identified characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, which are associated with cHL outcomes, biomarkers that are developed and validated in this high-risk group are still missing. Here, we applied whole-slide image analysis (WSI), a quantitative, large-scale assessment of tumor composition that utilizes conventional histopathology slides. We conducted WSI on a study cohort with pre-treatment biopsies of 340 advanced-stage cHL patients enrolled in the HD12 and HD15 trials of the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG), and tested our results in in a validation cohort of 147 advanced-stage cHL patients within the GHSG HD18 trial. All patients were treated with BEACOPP-based regimens. By quantifying T cells, B cells, Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg-cells and macrophages with WSI, 80% of all cells in the tumor tissue were identified. Crucially, low B cell count was associated with significantly reduced progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), while T cell-, macrophage- and Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg-cell content was not associated with the risk of progression or relapse in the study cohort. We further validated low B cell content as a prognostic factor of PFS and OS in the validation cohort and demonstrate good inter-observer agreement of WSI. WSI may represent a key tool for risk stratification of advanced-stage cHL that can easily be added to the standard diagnostic histopathology work-up.

%X The proximal DNA damage response kinase ATM is frequently inactivated in human malignancies. Germline mutations in the ATM gene cause Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), characterized by cerebellar ataxia and cancer predisposition. Whether ATM deficiency impacts on tumor initiation or also on the maintenance of the malignant state is unclear. Here, we show that Atm reactivation in initially Atm-deficient B- and T cell lymphomas induces tumor regression. We further find a reduced T cell abundance in B cell lymphomas from Atm-defective mice and A-T patients. Using T cell-specific Atm-knockout models, as well as allogeneic transplantation experiments, we pinpoint impaired immune surveillance as a contributor to cancer predisposition and development. Moreover, we demonstrate that Atm-deficient T cells display impaired proliferation capacity upon stimulation, due to replication stress. Altogether, our data indicate that T cell-specific restoration of ATM activity or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may prevent lymphomagenesis in A-T patients.

%X BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) is home to proteins fulfilling numerous essential cellular processes, particularly in metabolism and mitochondrial function. All IMS proteins are nuclear encoded and synthesized in the cytosol and must therefore be correctly targeted and transported to the IMS, either through mitochondrial targeting sequences or conserved cysteines and the mitochondrial disulfide relay system. The mitochondrial oxidoreductase MIA40, which catalyzes disulfide formation in the IMS, is imported by the combined action of the protein AIFM1 and MIA40 itself. Here, we characterized the function of the conserved highly negatively charged C-terminal region of human MIA40. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the C-terminal region is critical during posttranslational mitochondrial import of MIA40, but is dispensable for MIA40 redox function in vitro and in intact cells. The C-terminal negatively charged region of MIA40 slowed import into mitochondria, which occurred with a half-time as slow as 90 min. During this time, the MIA40 precursor persisted in the cytosol in an unfolded state, and the C-terminal negatively charged region served in protecting MIA40 from proteasomal degradation. This stabilizing property of the MIA40 C-terminal region could also be conferred to a different mitochondrial precursor protein, COX19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the MIA40 precursor contains the stabilizing information to allow for postranslational import of sufficient amounts of MIA40 for full functionality of the essential disulfide relay. We thereby provide for the first time mechanistic insights into the determinants controlling cytosolic surveillance of IMS precursor proteins.

%X Single-cell transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of the cell composition of tumors and allowed us to identify new subtypes of cells. Despite rapid technological advancements, single-cell analysis remains resource-intense hampering the scalability that is required to profile a sufficient number of samples for clinical associations. Therefore, more scalable approaches are needed to understand the contribution of individual cell types to the development and treatment response of solid tumors such as esophageal adenocarcinoma where comprehensive genomic studies have only led to a small number of targeted therapies. Due to the limited treatment options and late diagnosis, esophageal adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis. Understanding the interaction between and dysfunction of individual cell populations provides an opportunity for the development of new interventions. In an attempt to address the technological and clinical needs, we developed a protocol for the separation of esophageal carcinoma tissue into leukocytes (CD45+), epithelial cells (EpCAM+), and fibroblasts (two out of PDGFRalpha, CD90, anti-fibroblast) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing. We confirm successful separation of the three cell populations by mapping their transcriptomic profiles to reference cell lineage expression data. Gene-level analysis further supports the isolation of individual cell populations with high expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD20 for leukocytes, CDH1 and MUC1 for epithelial cells, and FAP, SMA, COL1A1, and COL3A1 for fibroblasts. As a proof of concept, we profiled tumor samples of nine patients and explored expression differences in the three cell populations between tumor and normal tissue. Interestingly, we found that angiogenesis-related genes were upregulated in fibroblasts isolated from tumors compared with normal tissue. Overall, we suggest our protocol as a complementary and more scalable approach compared with single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate associations between clinical parameters and transcriptomic alterations of specific cell populations in esophageal adenocarcinoma.

%X BACKGROUND: Understanding how HLA polymorphisms may affect both susceptibility, course and severity of Covid-19 infection could help both at the clinical level to identify individuals at higher risk from the disease and at the epidemiological one to explain the differences in the epidemic trend among countries or even within a specific country. Covid-19 disease in Italy showed a peculiar geographical distribution from the northern most affected regions to the southern ones only slightly touched. METHODS: In this study we analysed the regional frequencies for the most common Italian haplotypes from the Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 at four-digit level). Then we performed Pearson correlation analyses among regional haplotypes estimated frequency in the population and Covid-19 incidence and mortality. RESULTS: In this study we found that the two most frequent HLA haplotypes in the Italian population, HLA-A*:01:01g-B*08:01 g-C*07:01g-DRB1*03:01g and HLA-A*02.01g-B*18.01g-C*07.01g-DRB1*11.04g, had a regional distribution overlapping that of Covid-19 and showed respectively a positive (suggestive of susceptibility) and negative (suggestive of protection) significant correlation with both Covid-19 incidence and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, in order to define such HLA haplotypes as a factor effectively associated to the disease susceptibility, the creation of national networks that can collect patients' samples from all regions for HLA typing should be highly encouraged.

%X The discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 systems has fueled a rapid expansion of gene editing adoption and has impacted pharmaceutical and biotechnology research substantially. Here, gene editing is used at an industrial scale to identify and validate new biological targets for precision medicines, with functional genomic screening having an increasingly important role. Functional genomic strategies provide a crucial link between observed biological phenomena and the genes that influence and drive those phenomena. Although such studies are not new, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in this arena is providing more robust datasets for target identification and validation. CRISPR-based screening approaches are also useful later in the drug development pipeline for understanding drug resistance and sensitivity ahead of entering clinical trials. This review examines the developing landscape for CRISPR screening technologies within the pharmaceutical industry and explores the next steps for this constantly evolving screening platform.

%X Translation initiation in human mitochondria relies upon specialized mitoribosomes and initiation factors, mtIF2 and mtIF3, which have diverged from their bacterial counterparts. Here we report two distinct mitochondrial pre-initiation assembly steps involving those factors. Single-particle cryo-EM revealed that in the first step, interactions between mitochondria-specific protein mS37 and mtIF3 keep the small mitoribosomal subunit in a conformation favorable for a subsequent accommodation of mtIF2 in the second step. Combination with fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy analyses suggests that mtIF3 promotes complex assembly without mRNA or initiator tRNA binding, where exclusion is achieved by the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of mtIF3. Finally, the association of large mitoribosomal subunit is required for initiator tRNA and leaderless mRNA recruitment to form a stable initiation complex. These data reveal fundamental aspects of mammalian protein synthesis that are specific to mitochondria.

%X Dnmt3a2, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, is induced by neuronal activity and participates in long-term memory formation with the increased expression of synaptic plasticity genes. We wanted to determine if Dnmt3a2 with its partner Dnmt3L may influence motor behavior via the dopaminergic system. To this end, we generated a mouse line, Dnmt3a2/3L(Dat)(/wt), with dopamine transporter (DAT) promotor driven Dnmt3a2/3L overexpression. The mice were studied with behavioral paradigms (e.g., cylinder test, open field, and treadmill), brain slice patch clamp recordings, ex vivo metabolite analysis, and in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) using the dopaminergic tracer 6-[(18)F]FMT. The results showed that spontaneous activity and exercise performance were enhanced in Dnmt3a2/3L(Dat)(/wt) mice compared to Dnmt3a2/3L(wt)(/wt) controls. Dopaminergic substantia nigra pars compacta neurons of Dnmt3a2/3L(Dat)(/wt) animals displayed a higher fire frequency and excitability. However, dopamine concentration was not increased in the striatum, and dopamine metabolite concentration was even significantly decreased. Striatal 6-[(18)F]FMT uptake, reflecting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase activity, was the same in Dnmt3a2/3L(Dat)(/wt) mice and controls. [(18)F]FDG PET showed that hypothalamic metabolic activity was tightly linked to motor behavior in Dnmt3a2/3L(Dat)(/wt) mice. Furthermore, dopamine biosynthesis and motor-related metabolic activity were correlated in the hypothalamus. Our findings suggest that Dnmt3a2/3L, when overexpressed in dopaminergic neurons, modulates motor performance via activation of the nigrostriatal pathway. This does not involve increased dopamine synthesis.

%X UBR5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in distinct processes such as transcriptional regulation and development. UBR5 is highly upregulated in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), whereas its expression decreases with differentiation, suggesting a role for UBR5 in ESC function. However, little is known about how UBR5 regulates ESC identity. Here, we define the protein interactome of UBR5 in ESCs and find interactions with distinct components of the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, which is required for proper maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Notably, loss of UBR5 induces an abnormal accumulation of rRNA processing intermediates, resulting in diminished ribosomal levels. Consequently, lack of UBR5 triggers an increase in p53 levels and a concomitant decrease in cellular proliferation rates. Thus, our results indicate a link between UBR5 and rRNA maturation.

%X Splicing is a vital cellular process that modulates important aspects of animal physiology, yet roles in regulating innate immunity are relatively unexplored. From genetic screens in C. elegans, we identified splicing factor RNP-6/PUF60 whose activity suppresses immunity, but promotes longevity, suggesting a tradeoff between these processes. Bacterial pathogen exposure affects gene expression and splicing in a rnp-6 dependent manner, and rnp-6 gain and loss-of-function activities reveal an active role in immune regulation. Another longevity promoting splicing factor, SFA-1, similarly exerts an immuno-suppressive effect, working downstream or parallel to RNP-6. RNP-6 acts through TIR-1/PMK-1/MAPK signaling to modulate immunity. The mammalian homolog, PUF60, also displays anti-inflammatory properties, and its levels swiftly decrease after bacterial infection in mammalian cells, implying a role in the host response. Altogether our findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved modulation of immunity by specific components of the splicing machinery.

%X The evolution of the adaptive immune system has provided vertebrates with a uniquely sophisticated immune toolkit, enabling them to mount precise immune responses against a staggeringly diverse range of antigens. Like other vertebrates, teleost fishes possess a complex and functional adaptive immune system; however, our knowledge of the complex antigen-receptor genes underlying its functionality has been restricted to a small number of experimental and agricultural species, preventing systematic investigation into how these crucial gene loci evolve. Here, we analyse the genomic structure of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene loci in the cyprinodontiforms, a diverse and important group of teleosts present in many different habitats across the world. We reconstruct the complete IGH loci of the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) and the southern platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus) and analyse their in vivo gene expression, revealing the presence of species-specific splice isoforms of transmembrane IGHM. We further characterize the IGH constant regions of 10 additional cyprinodontiform species, including guppy, Amazon molly, mummichog and mangrove killifish. Phylogenetic analysis of these constant regions suggests multiple independent rounds of duplication and deletion of the teleost-specific antibody class IGHZ in the cyprinodontiform lineage, demonstrating the extreme volatility of IGH evolution. Focusing on the cyprinodontiforms as a model taxon for comparative evolutionary immunology, this work provides novel genomic resources for studying adaptive immunity and sheds light on the evolutionary history of the adaptive immune system.

%X Pathogenic variants in FBXL4 cause a severe encephalopathic syndrome associated with mtDNA depletion and deficient oxidative phosphorylation. To gain further insight into the enigmatic pathophysiology caused by FBXL4 deficiency, we generated homozygous Fbxl4 knockout mice and found that they display a predominant perinatal lethality. Surprisingly, the few surviving animals are apparently normal until the age of 8-12 months when they gradually develop signs of mitochondrial dysfunction and weight loss. One-year-old Fbxl4 knockouts show a global reduction in a variety of mitochondrial proteins and mtDNA depletion, whereas lysosomal proteins are upregulated. Fibroblasts from patients with FBXL4 deficiency and human FBXL4 knockout cells also have reduced steady-state levels of mitochondrial proteins that can be attributed to increased mitochondrial turnover. Inhibition of lysosomal function in these cells reverses the mitochondrial phenotype, whereas proteasomal inhibition has no effect. Taken together, the results we present here show that FBXL4 prevents mitochondrial removal via autophagy and that loss of FBXL4 leads to decreased mitochondrial content and mitochondrial disease.

%X Increased cellular degradation by autophagy is a feature of many interventions that delay ageing. We report here that increased autophagy is necessary for reduced insulin-like signalling (IIS) to extend lifespan in Drosophila and is sufficient on its own to increase lifespan. We first established that the well-characterised lifespan extension associated with deletion of the insulin receptor substrate chico was completely abrogated by downregulation of the essential autophagy gene Atg5. We next directly induced autophagy by over-expressing the major autophagy kinase Atg1 and found that a mild increase in autophagy extended lifespan. Interestingly, strong Atg1 up-regulation was detrimental to lifespan. Transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches identified specific signatures mediated by varying levels of autophagy in flies. Transcriptional upregulation of mitochondrial-related genes was the signature most specifically associated with mild Atg1 upregulation and extended lifespan, whereas short-lived flies, possessing strong Atg1 overexpression, showed reduced mitochondrial metabolism and up-regulated immune system pathways. Increased proteasomal activity and reduced triacylglycerol levels were features shared by both moderate and high Atg1 overexpression conditions. These contrasting effects of autophagy on ageing and differential metabolic profiles highlight the importance of fine-tuning autophagy levels to achieve optimal healthspan and disease prevention.

%X Generating chromosome-level, haplotype-resolved assemblies of heterozygous genomes remains challenging. To address this, we developed gamete binning, a method based on single-cell sequencing of haploid gametes enabling separation of the whole-genome sequencing reads into haplotype-specific reads sets. After assembling the reads of each haplotype, the contigs are scaffolded to chromosome level using a genetic map derived from the gametes. We assemble the two genomes of a diploid apricot tree based on whole-genome sequencing of 445 individual pollen grains. The two haplotype assemblies (N50: 25.5 and 25.8 Mb) feature a haplotyping precision of greater than 99% and are accurately scaffolded to chromosome-level.

%X Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a heritable biomarker of genomic aging. In this study, we perform a genome-wide meta-analysis of LTL by pooling densely genotyped and imputed association results across large-scale European-descent studies including up to 78,592 individuals. We identify 49 genomic regions at a false dicovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 threshold and prioritize genes at 31, with five highlighting nucleotide metabolism as an important regulator of LTL. We report six genome-wide significant loci in or near SENP7, MOB1B, CARMIL1, PRRC2A, TERF2, and RFWD3, and our results support recently identified PARP1, POT1, ATM, and MPHOSPH6 loci. Phenome-wide analyses in >350,000 UK Biobank participants suggest that genetically shorter telomere length increases the risk of hypothyroidism and decreases the risk of thyroid cancer, lymphoma, and a range of proliferative conditions. Our results replicate previously reported associations with increased risk of coronary artery disease and lower risk for multiple cancer types. Our findings substantially expand current knowledge on genes that regulate LTL and their impact on human health and disease.

%X Astrocytes represent central regulators of brain glucose metabolism and neuronal function. They have recently been shown to adapt their function in response to alterations in nutritional state through responding to the energy state-sensing hormones leptin and insulin. Here, we demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 inhibits glucose uptake and promotes beta-oxidation in cultured astrocytes. Conversely, postnatal GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) deletion in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes impairs astrocyte mitochondrial integrity and activates an integrated stress response with enhanced fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 production and increased brain glucose uptake. Accordingly, central neutralization of FGF21 or astrocyte-specific FGF21 inactivation abrogates the improvements in glucose tolerance and learning in mice lacking GLP-1R expression in astrocytes. Collectively, these experiments reveal a role for astrocyte GLP-1R signaling in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, and lack of GLP-1R signaling mounts an adaptive stress response resulting in an improvement of systemic glucose homeostasis and memory formation.

%X Effector functions of immunoglobulin G (IgG) are regulated by the composition of a glycan moiety, thus affecting activity of the immune system. Aberrant glycosylation of IgG has been observed in many diseases, but little is understood about the underlying mechanisms. We performed a genome-wide association study of IgG N-glycosylation (N = 8090) and, using a data-driven network approach, suggested how associated loci form a functional network. We confirmed in vitro that knockdown of IKZF1 decreases the expression of fucosyltransferase FUT8, resulting in increased levels of fucosylated glycans, and suggest that RUNX1 and RUNX3, together with SMARCB1, regulate expression of glycosyltransferase MGAT3. We also show that variants affecting the expression of genes involved in the regulation of glycoenzymes colocalize with variants affecting risk for inflammatory diseases. This study provides new evidence that variation in key transcription factors coupled with regulatory variation in glycogenes modifies IgG glycosylation and has influence on inflammatory diseases.

%X OBJECTIVE: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the FTO gene encoding an m(6)Am and an m(6)A demethylase are associated with obesity. Moreover, recent studies have linked a dysregulation of m(6)A modifications and its machinery, including FTO, to the development of several forms of cancers. However, the functional role of hepatic FTO in metabolism and the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a proteotypic obesity-associated cancer, remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to reveal the role of hepatic FTO in metabolism and in the initiation and progression of HCC in vivo. METHODS: We generated mice with hepatic FTO deficiency (FTO(L-KO)). The effect of hepatic FTO on metabolism was investigated by extensive metabolic phenotyping. To determine the impact of hepatic FTO on HCC development, FTO(L-KO) and Ctrl mice were subjected to long-term diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC-development and the tumor initiation phase was examined via a short-term DEN protocol. RESULTS: In long-term DEN experiments, FTO(L-KO) mice exhibit increased HCC burden compared to Ctrl mice. In the tumor initiation phase, Ctrl mice display a dynamic regulation of FTO upon induction of liver damage, while this response is abrogated in FTO-deficient mice. Proteomic analyses revealed that liver damage-induced increases in FTO expression reduce CUL4A protein abundance. Functionally, simultaneous knockdown of Cul4a reverses the increased hepatocyte proliferation observed upon loss of FTO. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our study demonstrates that hepatic FTO is dispensable for the control of energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. However, we show a protective function of FTO in liver carcinogenesis and suggest the FTO-dependent dynamic mRNA demethylation of Cul4a in the initiation of HCC development contributes to this effect.

%X Activation of the hexosamine pathway (HP) through gain-of-function mutations in its rate-limiting enzyme glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT-1) ameliorates proteotoxicity and increases lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we investigate the role of the HP in mammalian protein quality control. In mouse neuronal cells, elevation of HP activity led to phosphorylation of both PERK and eIF2alpha as well as downstream ATF4 activation, identifying the HP as a modulator of the integrated stress response (ISR). Increasing uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) levels through GFAT1 gain-of-function mutations or supplementation with the precursor GlcNAc reduces aggregation of the polyglutamine (polyQ) protein Ataxin-3. Blocking PERK signaling or autophagy suppresses this effect. In C. elegans, overexpression of gfat-1 likewise activates the ISR. Consistently, co-overexpression of gfat-1 and proteotoxic polyQ peptides in muscles reveals a strong protective cell-autonomous role of the HP. Thus, the HP has a conserved role in improving protein quality control through modulation of the ISR.

%X All animals have evolved the ability to survive nutrient deprivation, and nutrient signaling pathways are conserved modulators of health and disease. In C. elegans, late-larval starvation provokes the adult reproductive diapause (ARD), a long-lived quiescent state that enables survival for months without food, yet underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that ARD is distinct from other forms of diapause, showing little requirement for canonical longevity pathways, autophagy, and fat metabolism. Instead it requires the HLH-30/TFEB transcription factor to promote the morphological and physiological remodeling involved in ARD entry, survival, and recovery, suggesting that HLH-30 is a master regulator of reproductive quiescence. HLH-30 transcriptome and genetic analyses reveal that Max-like HLH factors, AMP-kinase, mTOR, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial fusion are target processes that promote ARD longevity. ARD thus rewires metabolism to ensure long-term survival and may illuminate similar mechanisms acting in stem cell quiescence and long-term fasting.

%X Strategies for installing authentic ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) at desired positions are fundamental for creating the tools needed to explore this elusive post-translational modification (PTM) in essential cellular processes. Here, we describe a phospho-guided chemoenzymatic approach based on the Ser-ADPr writer complex for rapid, scalable preparation of a panel of pure, precisely modified peptides. Integrating this methodology with phage display technology, we have developed site-specific as well as broad-specificity antibodies to mono-ADPr. These recombinant antibodies have been selected and characterized using multiple ADP-ribosylated peptides and tested by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for their ability to detect physiological ADPr events. Mono-ADPr proteomics and poly-to-mono comparisons at the modification site level have revealed the prevalence of mono-ADPr upon DNA damage and illustrated its dependence on PARG and ARH3. These and future tools created on our versatile chemical biology-recombinant antibody platform have broad potential to elucidate ADPr signaling pathways in health and disease.

%X The intestine is an organ essential to organismal nutrient absorption, metabolic control, barrier function and immunoprotection. The Caenorhabditis elegans intestine consists of 20 cells harboring a dense intermediate filament network positioned below the apical plasma membrane that forms a junction-anchored sheath around the intestinal lumen. This evolutionarily conserved arrangement provides mechanical and overall stress-protection, and it serves as an important model for deciphering the role of intestinal architecture in metazoan biology. We recently reported that the loss-of-function mutation of the intestinal intermediate filament organizer IFO-1 perturbs this architecture, leading to reduced body size and reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the IFO-1 mutation dramatically affects cholesterol metabolism. Mutants showed an increased sensitivity to cholesterol depletion, reduced cholesterol uptake, and cholesterol transfer to the gonads, which is also observed in worms completely lacking an intermediate filament network. Accordingly, we found striking similarities to transcriptome and lipidome profiles of a nuclear hormone receptor (NHR)-8 mutant. NHR-8 is homologous to mammalian LXR (liver X receptor) that serves as a sterol sensor and transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism. Remarkably, increasing exogenous cholesterol partially rescues the developmental retardation in IFO-1 mutants. Our results uncover a novel link of the intestinal intermediate filament cytoskeleton to cholesterol metabolism that contributes to compromised growth and reproduction.

%X BACKGROUND: The increasing age of global populations highlights the urgent need to understand the biological underpinnings of ageing. To this end, inhibition of the insulin/insulin-like signalling (IIS) pathway can extend healthy lifespan in diverse animal species, but with trade-offs including delayed development. It is possible that distinct cell types underlie effects on development and ageing; cell-type-specific strategies could therefore potentially avoid negative trade-offs when targeting diseases of ageing, including prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. The highly conserved diversity of neuronal and non-neuronal (glial) cell types in the Drosophila nervous system makes it an attractive system to address this possibility. We have thus investigated whether IIS in distinct glial cell populations differentially modulates development and lifespan in Drosophila. RESULTS: We report here that glia-specific IIS inhibition, using several genetic means, delays development while extending healthy lifespan. The effects on lifespan can be recapitulated by adult-onset IIS inhibition, whereas developmental IIS inhibition is dispensable for modulation of lifespan. Notably, the effects we observe on both lifespan and development act through the PI3K branch of the IIS pathway and are dependent on the transcription factor FOXO. Finally, IIS inhibition in several glial subtypes can delay development without extending lifespan, whereas the same manipulations in astrocyte-like glia alone are sufficient to extend lifespan without altering developmental timing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a role for distinct glial subpopulations in the organism-wide modulation of development and lifespan, with IIS in astrocyte-like glia contributing to lifespan modulation but not to developmental timing. Our results enable a more complete picture of the cell-type-specific effects of the IIS network, a pathway whose evolutionary conservation in humans make it tractable for therapeutic interventions. Our findings therefore underscore the necessity for cell-type-specific strategies to optimise interventions for the diseases of ageing.

%X Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant and accumulate with age in neurons of diverse species. However, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized, and their role during aging has not been addressed. Here, we use transcriptome profiling during aging and find that accumulation of circRNAs is slowed down in long-lived insulin mutant flies. Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene. Our study demonstrates that insulin signaling affects global circRNA accumulation and reveals an important role of circSfl during aging in vivo.

%X The evolutionary forces shaping life history divergence within species are largely unknown. Turquoise killifish display differences in lifespan among wild populations, representing an ideal natural experiment in evolution and diversification of life history. By combining genome sequencing and population genetics, we investigate the evolutionary forces shaping lifespan among wild turquoise killifish populations. We generate an improved reference genome assembly and identify genes under positive and purifying selection, as well as those evolving neutrally. Short-lived populations from the outer margin of the species range have small population size and accumulate deleterious mutations in genes significantly enriched in the WNT signaling pathway, neurodegeneration, cancer and the mTOR pathway. We propose that limited population size due to habitat fragmentation and repeated population bottlenecks, by increasing the genome-wide mutation load, exacerbates the effects of mutation accumulation and cumulatively contribute to the short adult lifespan.

%X At a recent symposium on aging biology, a debate was held as to whether or not we know what biological aging is. Most of the participants were struck not only by the lack of consensus on this core question, but also on many basic tenets of the field. Accordingly, we undertook a systematic survey of our 71 participants on key questions that were raised during the debate and symposium, eliciting 37 responses. The results confirmed the impression from the symposium: there is marked disagreement on the most fundamental questions in the field, and little consensus on anything other than the heterogeneous nature of aging processes. Areas of major disagreement included what participants viewed as the essence of aging, when it begins, whether aging is programmed or not, whether we currently have a good understanding of aging mechanisms, whether aging is or will be quantifiable, whether aging will be treatable, and whether many non-aging species exist. These disagreements lay bare the urgent need for a more unified and cross-disciplinary paradigm in the biology of aging that will clarify both areas of agreement and disagreement, allowing research to proceed more efficiently. We suggest directions to encourage the emergence of such a paradigm.

%X Autophagy is a conserved catabolic homeostasis process central for cellular and organismal health. During autophagy, small single-membrane phagophores rapidly expand into large double-membrane autophagosomes to encapsulate diverse cargoes for degradation. It is thought that autophagic membranes are mainly derived from preformed organelle membranes. Instead, here we delineate a pathway that expands the phagophore membrane by localized phospholipid synthesis. Specifically, we find that the conserved acyl-CoA synthetase Faa1 accumulates on nucleated phagophores and locally activates fatty acids (FAs) required for phagophore elongation and autophagy. Strikingly, using isotopic FA tracing, we directly show that Faa1 channels activated FAs into the synthesis of phospholipids and promotes their assembly into autophagic membranes. Indeed, the first committed steps of de novo phospholipid synthesis at the ER, which forms stable contacts with nascent autophagosomes, are essential for autophagy. Together, our work illuminates how cells spatially tune synthesis and flux of phospholipids for autophagosome biogenesis during autophagy.

%X During (macro)autophagy, cells form transient organelles, termed autophagosomes, to target a broad spectrum of substrates for degradation critical to cellular and organismal health. Driven by rapid membrane assembly, an initially small vesicle (phagophore) elongates into a large cup-shaped structure to engulf substrates within a few minutes in a double-membrane autophagosome. In particular, how autophagic membranes expand has been a longstanding question. Here, we summarize our recent work that delineates a pathway that drives phagophore expansion by localized de novo phospholipid synthesis. Specifically, we found that the conserved acyl-CoA synthetase Faa1 localizes to nucleated phagophores to locally activate fatty acids for de novo phospholipid synthesis in the neighboring ER. These newly synthesized phospholipids are then preferentially incorporated into autophagic membranes and drive the expansion of the phagophore into a functional autophagosome. In summary, our work uncovers molecular principles of how cells coordinate phospholipid synthesis and flux with autophagic membrane formation during autophagy.Abbreviations: ACS: acyl-CoA synthestases; CoA: coenzyme A; ER: endoplasmic reticulum.

%X The Drosophila larva has been used to investigate many processes in cell biology, including morphogenesis, physiology and responses to drugs and new therapeutic compounds. Despite its enormous potential as a model system, longer-term live imaging has been technically challenging because of a lack of efficient methods for immobilizing larvae for extended periods. We describe here a simple procedure for anesthetization and uninterrupted long-term in vivo imaging of the epidermis and other larval organs, including gut, imaginal discs, neurons, fat body, tracheae, muscles and hemocytes, for up to 8 h. We also include a procedure for probing cell properties by laser ablation. We provide a survey of the effects of different anesthetics, demonstrating that short exposure to diethyl ether is the most effective for long-term immobilization of larvae. This protocol does not require specific expertise beyond basic Drosophila genetics and husbandry, and confocal microscopy. It enables high-resolution studies of many systemic and subcellular processes in larvae.

%X Loci associated with longevity are likely to harbor genes coding for key players of molecular pathways involved in a lifelong decreased mortality and decreased/compressed morbidity. However, identifying such loci is challenging. One of the most plausible reasons is the uncertainty in defining long-lived cases with the heritable longevity trait among long-living phenocopies. To avoid phenocopies, family selection scores have been constructed, but these have not yet been adopted as state of the art in longevity research. Here, we aim to identify individuals with the heritable longevity trait by using current insights and a novel family score based on these insights. We use a unique dataset connecting living study participants to their deceased ancestors covering 37,825 persons from 1,326 five-generational families, living between 1788 and 2019. Our main finding suggests that longevity is transmitted for at least two subsequent generations only when at least 20% of all relatives are long-lived. This proves the importance of family data to avoid phenocopies in genetic studies.

%X Glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) is the key enzyme in the hexosamine pathway (HP) that produces uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), linking energy metabolism with posttranslational protein glycosylation. In Caenorhabditis elegans, we previously identified gfat-1 gain-of-function mutations that elevate UDP-GlcNAc levels, improve protein homeostasis, and extend lifespan. GFAT is highly conserved, but the gain-of-function mechanism and its relevance in mammalian cells remained unclear. Here, we present the full-length crystal structure of human GFAT-1 in complex with various ligands and with important mutations. UDP-GlcNAc directly interacts with GFAT-1, inhibiting catalytic activity. The longevity-associated G451E variant shows drastically reduced sensitivity to UDP-GlcNAc inhibition in enzyme activity assays. Our structural and functional data point to a critical role of the interdomain linker in UDP-GlcNAc inhibition. In mammalian cells, the G451E variant potently activates the HP. Therefore, GFAT-1 gain-of-function through loss of feedback inhibition constitutes a potential target for the treatment of age-related proteinopathies.

%X Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing neurons are key regulators of energy and glucose homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that they provide dense projections to the median eminence (ME) in close proximity to tanycytes and fenestrated vessels. Chemogenetic activation of MCH neurons as well as optogenetic stimulation of their projections in the ME enhance permeability of the ME by increasing fenestrated vascular loops and enhance leptin action in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). Unbiased phosphoRiboTrap-based assessment of cell activation upon chemogenetic MCH neuron activation reveals MCH-neuron-dependent regulation of endothelial cells. MCH neurons express the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and blocking VEGF-R signaling attenuates the leptin-sensitizing effect of MCH neuron activation. Our experiments reveal that MCH neurons directly regulate permeability of the ME barrier, linking the activity of energy state and sleep regulatory neurons to the regulation of hormone accessibility to the ARC.

%X BACKGROUND: The blood metabolome incorporates cues from the environment and the host's genetic background, potentially offering a holistic view of an individual's health status. METHODS: We have compiled a vast resource of proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and phenotypic data encompassing over 25 000 samples derived from 26 community and hospital-based cohorts. RESULTS: Using this resource, we constructed a metabolomics-based age predictor (metaboAge) to calculate an individual's biological age. Exploration in independent cohorts demonstrates that being judged older by one's metabolome, as compared with one's chronological age, confers an increased risk on future cardiovascular disease, mortality, and functionality in older individuals. A web-based tool for calculating metaboAge (metaboage.researchlumc.nl) allows easy incorporation in other epidemiological studies. Access to data can be requested at bbmri.nl/samples-images-data. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we present a vast resource of metabolomics data and illustrate its merit by constructing a metabolomics-based score for biological age that captures aspects of current and future cardiometabolic health.

%X Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from all organisms undergoes post-transcriptional modifications that increase the diversity of its composition and activity. In mitochondria, specialized mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) are responsible for the synthesis of 13 oxidative phosphorylation proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Mitoribosomal RNA is also modified, with 10 modifications thus far identified and all corresponding modifying enzymes described. This form of epigenetic regulation of mitochondrial gene expression affects mitoribosome biogenesis and function. Here, we provide an overview on rRNA methylation and highlight critical work that is beginning to elucidate its role in mitochondrial gene expression. Given the similarities between bacterial and mitochondrial ribosomes, we focus on studies involving Escherichia coli and human models. Furthermore, we highlight the use of state-of-the-art technologies, such as cryoEM in the study of rRNA methylation and its biological relevance. Understanding the mechanisms and functional relevance of this process represents an exciting frontier in the RNA biology and mitochondrial fields.

%X Occupying the interface between host and environment, host-associated microbes play fundamental roles in nutrient absorption, essential metabolite synthesis, development of the immune system, defence against pathogens and pathogenesis. Microbiota composition and function is rather stable during adulthood, while it dramatically changes during early development, frailty and disease. Ageing is associated with progressive decrease of homeostasis, often resulting in disruption of the physiological balance between host and commensal microbes, ultimately leading to dysbiosis and host demise. Generally, high microbial diversity is associated with health and a youthful state, while low individual microbial diversity and larger inter-individual microbial diversity is associated with ageing and disease states. Different species are equipped with species-specific commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microbial communities. How and whether the specific host-microbiota consortia co-evolved with host physiology to ensure homeostasis and promote individual fitness remains an open question. In this essay, we propose that the evolution of vertebrate-specific immune adaptations may have enabled the establishment of highly diverse, species-specific commensal microbial communities. We discuss how the maintenance of intact immune surveillance mechanisms, which allow discrimination between commensal and pathogenic bacteria, fail during ageing and lead to the onset of known ageing-related diseases. We discuss how host-microbiota interactions are key to maintaining homeostasis despite external perturbations, but also how they affect a range of host-specific ageing-related phenotypes. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of the microbiome in host evolution'.

%X Astrocytes have emerged for playing important roles in brain tissue repair; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that acute injury and blood-brain barrier disruption trigger the formation of a prominent mitochondrial-enriched compartment in astrocytic endfeet, which enables vascular remodeling. Integrated imaging approaches revealed that this mitochondrial clustering is part of an adaptive response regulated by fusion dynamics. Astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) suppressed perivascular mitochondrial clustering and disrupted mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites. Functionally, two-photon imaging experiments showed that these structural changes were mirrored by impaired mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake leading to abnormal cytosolic transients within endfeet in vivo. At the tissue level, a compromised vascular complexity in the lesioned area was restored by boosting mitochondrial-ER perivascular tethering in MFN2-deficient astrocytes. These data unmask a crucial role for mitochondrial dynamics in coordinating astrocytic local domains and have important implications for repairing the injured brain.

%X Mitochondria are essential metabolic hubs that dynamically adapt to physiological demands. More than 40 proteases residing in different compartments of mitochondria, termed mitoproteases, preserve mitochondrial proteostasis and are emerging as central regulators of mitochondrial plasticity. These multifaceted enzymes limit the accumulation of short-lived, regulatory proteins within mitochondria, modulate the activity of mitochondrial proteins by protein processing, and mediate the degradation of damaged proteins. Various signaling cascades coordinate the activity of mitoproteases to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis and ensure cell survival. Loss of mitoproteases severely impairs the functional integrity of mitochondria, is associated with aging, and causes pleiotropic diseases. Understanding the dual function of mitoproteases as regulatory and quality control enzymes will help unravel the role of mitochondrial plasticity in aging and disease.

%X Mitochondrial function, largely regulated by the dynamics of this organelle, is inextricably linked to the oocyte health. In comparison with most somatic cells, mitochondria in oocytes are smaller and rounder in appearance, suggesting limited fusion. The functional implications of this distinct morphology, and how changes in the mitochondrial shape translate to mitochondrial function in oogenesis is little understood. We, therefore, asked whether the pro-fusion proteins mitofusins 1 (MFN1) and 2 (MFN2) are required for the oocyte development. Here we show that oocyte-specific deletion of Mfn1, but not Mfn2, prevents the oocyte growth and ovulation due to a block in folliculogenesis. We pinpoint the loss of oocyte growth and ovulation to impaired PI3K-Akt signaling and disrupted oocyte-somatic cell communication. In support, the double loss of Mfn1 and Mfn2 partially rescues the impaired PI3K-Akt signaling and defects in oocyte development secondary to the single loss of Mfn1. Together, this work demonstrates that the mitochondrial function influences the cellular signaling during the oocyte development, and highlights the importance of distinct, nonredundant roles of MFN1 and MFN2 in oogenesis.

%X Ageing phenotypes, such as years lived in good health (healthspan), total years lived (lifespan), and survival until an exceptional old age (longevity), are of interest to us all but require exceptionally large sample sizes to study genetically. Here we combine existing genome-wide association summary statistics for healthspan, parental lifespan, and longevity in a multivariate framework, increasing statistical power, and identify 10 genomic loci which influence all three phenotypes, of which five (near FOXO3, SLC4A7, LINC02513, ZW10, and FGD6) have not been reported previously at genome-wide significance. The majority of these 10 loci are associated with cardiovascular disease and some affect the expression of genes known to change their activity with age. In total, we implicate 78 genes, and find these to be enriched for ageing pathways previously highlighted in model organisms, such as the response to DNA damage, apoptosis, and homeostasis. Finally, we identify a pathway worthy of further study: haem metabolism.

%X Microglia, the brain's resident macrophages, help to regulate brain function by removing dying neurons, pruning non-functional synapses, and producing ligands that support neuronal survival(1). Here we show that microglia are also critical modulators of neuronal activity and associated behavioural responses in mice. Microglia respond to neuronal activation by suppressing neuronal activity, and ablation of microglia amplifies and synchronizes the activity of neurons, leading to seizures. Suppression of neuronal activation by microglia occurs in a highly region-specific fashion and depends on the ability of microglia to sense and catabolize extracellular ATP, which is released upon neuronal activation by neurons and astrocytes. ATP triggers the recruitment of microglial protrusions and is converted by the microglial ATP/ADP hydrolysing ectoenzyme CD39 into AMP; AMP is then converted into adenosine by CD73, which is expressed on microglia as well as other brain cells. Microglial sensing of ATP, the ensuing microglia-dependent production of adenosine, and the adenosine-mediated suppression of neuronal responses via the adenosine receptor A1R are essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and animal behaviour. Our findings suggest that this microglia-driven negative feedback mechanism operates similarly to inhibitory neurons and is essential for protecting the brain from excessive activation in health and disease.

%X Neurodegeneration in mitochondrial disorders is considered irreversible because of limited metabolic plasticity in neurons, yet the cell-autonomous implications of mitochondrial dysfunction for neuronal metabolism in vivo are poorly understood. Here, we profiled the cell-specific proteome of Purkinje neurons undergoing progressive OXPHOS deficiency caused by disrupted mitochondrial fusion dynamics. We found that mitochondrial dysfunction triggers a profound rewiring of the proteomic landscape, culminating in the sequential activation of precise metabolic programs preceding cell death. Unexpectedly, we identified a marked induction of pyruvate carboxylase (PCx) and other anaplerotic enzymes involved in replenishing tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Suppression of PCx aggravated oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, showing that anaplerosis is protective in OXPHOS-deficient neurons. Restoration of mitochondrial fusion in end-stage degenerating neurons fully reversed these metabolic hallmarks, thereby preventing cell death. Our findings identify a previously unappreciated pathway conferring resilience to mitochondrial dysfunction and show that neurodegeneration can be reversed even at advanced disease stages.

%X Inhibition of signalling through several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including the insulin-like growth factor receptor and its orthologues, extends healthy lifespan in organisms from diverse evolutionary taxa. This raises the possibility that other RTKs, including those already well studied for their roles in cancer and developmental biology, could be promising targets for extending healthy lifespan. Here, we focus on anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk), an RTK with established roles in nervous system development and in multiple cancers, but whose effects on aging remain unclear. We find that several means of reducing Alk signalling, including mutation of its ligand jelly belly (jeb), RNAi knock-down of Alk, or expression of dominant-negative Alk in adult neurons, can extend healthy lifespan in female, but not male, Drosophila. Moreover, reduced Alk signalling preserves neuromuscular function with age, promotes resistance to starvation and xenobiotic stress, and improves night sleep consolidation. We find further that inhibition of Alk signalling in adult neurons modulates the expression of several insulin-like peptides, providing a potential mechanistic link between neuronal Alk signalling and organism-wide insulin-like signalling. Finally, we show that TAE-684, a small molecule inhibitor of Alk, can extend healthy lifespan in Drosophila, suggesting that the repurposing of Alk inhibitors may be a promising direction for strategies to promote healthy aging.

%X Mitochondria are multidimensional organelles whose activities are essential to cellular vitality and organismal longevity, yet underlying regulatory mechanisms spanning these different levels of organization remain elusive(1-5). Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear transcription factor Y, beta subunit (NFYB-1), a subunit of the NF-Y transcriptional complex(6-8), is a crucial regulator of mitochondrial function. Identified in RNA interference (RNAi) screens, NFYB-1 loss leads to perturbed mitochondrial gene expression, reduced oxygen consumption, mitochondrial fragmentation, disruption of mitochondrial stress pathways, decreased mitochondrial cardiolipin levels and abolition of organismal longevity triggered by mitochondrial impairment. Multi-omics analysis reveals that NFYB-1 is a potent repressor of lysosomal prosaposin, a regulator of glycosphingolipid metabolism. Limiting prosaposin expression unexpectedly restores cardiolipin production, mitochondrial function and longevity in the nfyb-1 background. Similarly, cardiolipin supplementation rescues nfyb-1 phenotypes. These findings suggest that the NFYB-1-prosaposin axis coordinates lysosomal to mitochondria signalling via lipid pools to enhance cellular mitochondrial function and organismal health.

%X Steroids are essential structural components of cell membranes that organize lipid rafts and modulate membrane fluidity. They can also act as signalling molecules that work through nuclear and G protein-coupled receptors to impact health and disease. Notably, changes in steroid levels have been implicated in metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, but how alterations in the steroid pool affect ageing is less well understood. One of the major challenges in steroidomic analysis is the ability to simultaneously detect and distinguish various steroids due to low in vivo concentrations and naturally occurring stereoisomers. Here, we established such a method to study the mass spectrometry behaviour of nine sterols/steroids and related molecules (cholesterol precursors: squalene, lanosterol; sterol metabolites; 7 Dehydrocholesterol, 24, 25 and 27 Hydroxycholesterol; and steroids: progesterone, testosterone, and corticosterone) during ageing in the African turquoise killifish, a new model for studying vertebrate longevity. We find that levels of all tested steroids change significantly with age in multiple tissues, suggesting that specific steroids could be used as biomarkers of ageing. These findings pave the way for use of Nothobranchius furzeri as a novel model organism to unravel the role of sterols/steroids in ageing and age-related diseases. Graphical abstract.

%X Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Genome-wide association studies have linked PICALM to AD risk. PICALM has been implicated in Abeta42 production and turnover, but whether it plays a direct role in modulating Abeta42 toxicity remains unclear. We found that increased expression of the Drosophila PICALM orthologue lap could rescue Abeta42 toxicity in an adult-onset model of AD, without affecting Abeta42 level. Imbalances in the glutamatergic system, leading to excessive, toxic stimulation, have been associated with AD. We found that Abeta42 caused the accumulation of presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) and increased spontaneous glutamate release. Increased lap expression reversed these phenotypes back to control levels, suggesting that lap may modulate glutamatergic transmission. We also found that lap modulated the localization of amphiphysin (Amph), the homologue of another AD risk factor BIN1, and that Amph itself modulated postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluRII) localization. We propose a model where PICALM modulates glutamatergic transmission, together with BIN1, to ameliorate synaptic dysfunction and disease progression.

%X The metabolic state of an organism instructs gene expression modalities, leading to changes in complex life history traits, such as longevity. Dietary restriction (DR), which positively affects health and life span across species, leads to metabolic reprogramming that enhances utilisation of fatty acids for energy generation. One direct consequence of this metabolic shift is the upregulation of cytoprotective (CyTP) genes categorized in the Gene Ontology (GO) term of "Xenobiotic Detoxification Program" (XDP). How an organism senses metabolic changes during nutritional stress to alter gene expression programs is less known. Here, using a genetic model of DR, we show that the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially linoleic acid (LA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are increased following DR and these PUFAs are able to activate the CyTP genes. This activation of CyTP genes is mediated by the conserved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway. Consequently, genes of the PUFA biosynthesis and p38-MAPK pathway are required for multiple paradigms of DR-mediated longevity, suggesting conservation of mechanism. Thus, our study shows that PUFAs and p38-MAPK pathway function downstream of DR to help communicate the metabolic state of an organism to regulate expression of CyTP genes, ensuring extended life span.

%X Although death is inevitable, individuals have long sought to alter the course of the ageing process. Indeed, ageing has proved to be modifiable; by intervening in biological systems, such as nutrient sensing, cellular senescence, the systemic environment and the gut microbiome, phenotypes of ageing can be slowed sufficiently to mitigate age-related functional decline. These interventions can also delay the onset of many disabling, chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration, in animal models. Here, we examine the most promising interventions to slow ageing and group them into two tiers based on the robustness of the preclinical, and some clinical, results, in which the top tier includes rapamycin, senolytics, metformin, acarbose, spermidine, NAD(+) enhancers and lithium. We then focus on the potential of the interventions and the feasibility of conducting clinical trials with these agents, with the overall aim of maintaining health for longer before the end of life.

%X Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process critical for cell homeostasis with broad implications for aging and age-associated diseases. A defining feature of autophagy is the de novo formation of a specialized transient organelle, the double-membrane autophagosome. Autophagosomes originate from small vesicular precursors after rapid membrane expansion resulting in the engulfment of a broad spectrum of cytoplasmic cargoes within a few minutes for vacuolar or lysosomal degradation. Recent advances have provided exciting new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly of autophagic membranes during autophagosome biogenesis. Specifically, the phospholipid biosynthesis activity of the endoplasmic reticulum and a dedicated membrane-tethering complex between nascent autophagosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum have emerged as key factors in autophagosome formation.

%X Autophagosomes form de novo in a manner that is incompletely understood. Particularly enigmatic are autophagy-related protein 9 (Atg9)-containing vesicles that are required for autophagy machinery assembly but do not supply the bulk of the autophagosomal membrane. In this study, we reconstituted autophagosome nucleation using recombinant components from yeast. We found that Atg9 proteoliposomes first recruited the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase complex, followed by Atg21, the Atg2-Atg18 lipid transfer complex, and the E3-like Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex, which promoted Atg8 lipidation. Furthermore, we found that Atg2 could transfer lipids for Atg8 lipidation. In selective autophagy, these reactions could potentially be coupled to the cargo via the Atg19-Atg11-Atg9 interactions. We thus propose that Atg9 vesicles form seeds that establish membrane contact sites to initiate lipid transfer from compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum.

%X Mitochondria are multifaceted metabolic organelles and adapt dynamically to various developmental transitions and environmental challenges. The metabolic flexibility of mitochondria is provided by alterations in the mitochondrial proteome and is tightly coupled to changes in the shape of mitochondria. Mitochondrial proteases are emerging as important posttranslational regulators of mitochondrial plasticity. The i-AAA protease YME1L, an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane, coordinates mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics with the metabolic output of mitochondria. mTORC1-dependent lipid signaling drives proteolytic rewiring of mitochondria by YME1L. While the tissue-specific loss of YME1L in mice is associated with heart failure, disturbed eye development, and axonal degeneration in the spinal cord, YME1L activity supports growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. YME1L thus represents a key regulatory protease determining mitochondrial plasticity and metabolic reprogramming and is emerging as a promising therapeutic target.

%X The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are classically regarded as very dynamic organelles in cell lines. Their frequent morphological changes and repositioning underlie the transient generation of physical contact sites (so-called mitochondria-ER contacts, or MERCs) which are believed to support metabolic processes central for cellular signaling and function. The extent of regulation over these organelle dynamics has likely further achieved a higher level of complexity in polarized cells like neurons and astrocytes to match their elaborated geometries and specialized functions, thus ensuring the maintenance of MERCs at metabolically demanding locations far from the soma. Yet, live imaging of adult brain tissue has recently revealed that the true extent of mitochondrial dynamics in astrocytes is significantly lower than in cell culture settings. On one hand, this suggests that organelle dynamics in mature astroglia in vivo may be highly regulated and perhaps triggered only by defined physiological stimuli. On the other hand, this extent of control may greatly facilitate the stabilization of those MERCs required to maintain regionalized metabolic domains underlying key astrocytic functions. In this perspective, we review recent evidence suggesting that the resulting spatial distribution of mitochondria and ER in astrocytes in vivo may create the conditions for maintaining extensive MERCs within specialized territories - like perivascular endfeet - and discuss the possibility that their enrichment at these distal locations may facilitate specific forms of cellular plasticity relevant for physiology and disease.

%X Centenarians (exceptionally long-lived individuals-ELLI) are a unique segment of the population, exhibiting long human lifespan and healthspan, despite generally practicing similar lifestyle habits as their peers. We tested disease-associated mutation burden in ELLI genomes by determining the burden of pathogenic variants reported in the ClinVar and HGMD databases using data from whole exome sequencing (WES) conducted in a cohort of ELLI, their offspring, and control individuals without antecedents of familial longevity (n = 1879), all descendent from the founder population of Ashkenazi Jews. The burden of pathogenic variants did not differ between the three groups. Additional analyses of variants subtypes and variant effect predictor (VEP) biotype frequencies did not reveal a decrease of pathogenic or loss-of-function (LoF) variants in ELLI and offspring compared to the control group. Case-control pathogenic variants enrichment analyses conducted in ELLI and controls also did not identify significant differences in any of the variants between the groups and polygenic risk scores failed to provide a predictive model. Interestingly, cancer and Alzheimer's disease-associated variants were significantly depleted in ELLI compared to controls, suggesting slower accumulation of mutation. That said, polygenic risk score analysis failed to find any predictive variants among the functional variants tested. The high similarity in the burden of pathogenic variation between ELLI and individuals without familial longevity supports the notion that extension of lifespan and healthspan in ELLI is not a consequence of pathogenic variant depletion but rather a result of other genomic, epigenomic, or potentially nongenomic properties.

%X Altered expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) occurs in ageing and a range of human pathologies (for example, inborn errors of metabolism, neurodegeneration and cancer). Here we describe first-in-class specific inhibitors of mitochondrial transcription (IMTs) that target the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), which is essential for biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system(1-6). The IMTs efficiently impair mtDNA transcription in a reconstituted recombinant system and cause a dose-dependent inhibition of mtDNA expression and OXPHOS in cell lines. To verify the cellular target, we performed exome sequencing of mutagenized cells and identified a cluster of amino acid substitutions in POLRMT that cause resistance to IMTs. We obtained a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of POLRMT bound to an IMT, which further defined the allosteric binding site near the active centre cleft of POLRMT. The growth of cancer cells and the persistence of therapy-resistant cancer stem cells has previously been reported to depend on OXPHOS(7-17), and we therefore investigated whether IMTs have anti-tumour effects. Four weeks of oral treatment with an IMT is well-tolerated in mice and does not cause OXPHOS dysfunction or toxicity in normal tissues, despite inducing a strong anti-tumour response in xenografts of human cancer cells. In summary, IMTs provide a potent and specific chemical biology tool to study the role of mtDNA expression in physiology and disease.

%X The DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the most cytotoxic lesion and compromises genome stability. In an attempt to efficiently repair DSBs, cells activate ATM kinase, which orchestrates the DNA damage response (DDR) by activating cell cycle checkpoints and initiating DSB repair pathways. In physiological B cell development, however, programmed DSBs are generated as intermediates for effective immune responses and the maintenance of genomic integrity. Disturbances of these pathways are at the heart of B cell lymphomagenesis. Here, we review the role of DNA repair and cell cycle control on B cell development and lymphomagenesis. In addition, we highlight the intricate relationship between the DDR and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Lastly, we provide a clinical perspective by highlighting treatment possibilities of defective DDR signaling and the TME in mantle cell lymphoma, which serves as a blueprint for B cell lymphomas.

%X Metabolism rewiring is an important hallmark of cancers. Being one of the most abundant free amino acids in the human blood, glutamine supports bioenergetics and biosynthesis, tumor growth, and the production of antioxidants through glutaminolysis in cancers. In glutamine dependent cancer cells, more than half of the tricarboxylic/critic acid (TCA) metabolites are derived from glutamine. Glutaminolysis controls the process of converting glutamine into TCA cycle metabolites through the regulation of multiple enzymes, among which the glutaminase shows the importance as the very first step in this process. Targeting glutaminolysis via glutaminase inhibition emerges as a promising strategy to disrupt cancer metabolism and tumor progression. Here, we review the regulation of glutaminase and the role of glutaminase in cancer metabolism and metastasis. Furthermore, we highlight the glutaminase inhibitor based metabolic therapy strategy and their potential applications in clinical scenarios.

%X Lifespan is a remarkably diverse trait in nature, ranging from just hours in adult mayflies to hundreds of years in the Greenland shark and quahog clam. Great disparities in lifespan are often observed even among somewhat closely related species; for example, in the laboratory, wild-derived strains of the common house mouse have a maximum observed lifespan of approximately 6 years, while a similarly sized rodent, the naked mole rat, can live for over 30 years. Comparative biology of aging across the tree of life provides a tremendous opportunity for understanding the molecular and genetic basis underlying lifespan and aging. However, a lack of molecular and laboratory tools has limited the ability of researchers to take full advantage of the incredible diversity of aging phenotypes in nature. Recent developments in genomic technology have made it increasingly possible to study non-canonical model organisms for aging. One promising new genetic model organism amenable to a range of experimental interventions is the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri). This fish species has a naturally short lifespan and undergoes a wide range of aging-related transformations. These fish have a fully sequenced genome and transcriptome, and killifish embryos are accessible to transgenesis and genome editing. Furthermore, different killifish species and populations show striking differences in lifespan, providing the opportunity for comparative analysis of aging. This Review introduces the natural life history of the turquoise killifish, its emerging applicability as an aging model system, the genetic tools that have been developed to study aging for this species and a summary of recent studies facilitated by these new tools.

%X Accumulation of amyloid beta peptides is thought to initiate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the precise mechanisms mediating their neurotoxicity are unclear. Our microarray analyses show that, in Drosophila models of amyloid beta 42 toxicity, genes involved in the unfolded protein response and metabolic processes are upregulated in brain. Comparison with the brain transcriptome of early-stage Alzheimer's patients revealed a common transcriptional signature, but with generally opposing directions of gene expression changes between flies and humans. Among these differentially regulated genes, lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) was up-regulated by the greatest degree in amyloid beta 42 flies and the human orthologues (LDHA and LDHB) were down-regulated in patients. Functional analyses revealed that either over-expression or inhibition of Ldh by RNA interference (RNAi) slightly exacerbated climbing defects in both healthy and amyloid beta 42-induced Drosophila. This suggests that metabolic responses to lactate dehydrogenase must be finely-tuned, and that its observed upregulation following amyloid beta 42 production could potentially represent a compensatory protection to maintain pathway homeostasis in this model, with further manipulation leading to detrimental effects. The increased Ldh expression in amyloid beta 42 flies was regulated partially by unfolded protein response signalling, as ATF4 RNAi diminished the transcriptional response and enhanced amyloid beta 42-induced climbing phenotypes. Further functional studies are required to determine whether Ldh upregulation provides compensatory neuroprotection against amyloid beta 42-induced loss of activating transcription factor 4 activity and endoplasmatic reticulum stress. Our study thus reveals dysregulation of lactate dehydrogenase signalling in Drosophila models and patients with Alzheimer's disease, which may lead to a detrimental loss of metabolic homeostasis. Importantly, we observed that down-regulation of ATF4-dependent endoplasmic reticulum-stress signalling in this context appears to prevent Ldh compensation and to exacerbate amyloid beta 42-dependent neuronal toxicity. Our findings, therefore, suggest caution in the use of therapeutic strategies focussed on down-regulation of this pathway for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, since its natural response to the toxic peptide may induce beneficial neuroprotective effects.

%X ADP-ribosylation, a modification of proteins, nucleic acids and metabolites, confers broad functions, including roles in stress responses elicited for example by DNA damage and viral infection and is involved in intra- and extracellular signaling, chromatin and transcriptional regulation, protein biosynthesis and cell death. ADP-ribosylation is catalyzed by ADP-ribosyltransferases, which transfer ADP-ribose from NAD(+) onto substrates. The modification, which occurs as mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation, is reversible due to the action of different ADP-ribosylhydrolases. Importantly, inhibitors of ADP-ribosyltransferases are approved or are being developed for clinical use. Moreover, ADP-ribosylhydrolases are being assessed as therapeutic targets, foremost as anti-viral drugs and for oncological indications. Due to the development of novel reagents and major technological advances that allow the study of ADP-ribosylation in unprecedented detail, an increasing number of cellular processes and pathways are being identified that are regulated by ADP-ribosylation. In addition, characterization of biochemical and structural aspects of the ADP-ribosyltransferases and their catalytic activities have expanded our understanding of this protein family. This increased knowledge requires that a common nomenclature be used to describe the relevant enzymes. Therefore, in this viewpoint, we propose an updated and broadly supported nomenclature for mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases that will facilitate future discussions when addressing the biochemistry and biology of ADP-ribosylation. This is combined with a brief description of the main functions of mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases to illustrate the increasing diversity of mono- and poly-ADP-ribose mediated cellular processes.

%X Whether freshwater fish colonize remote islands following tectonic or transoceanic dispersal remains an evolutionary puzzle. Integrating dating of known tectonic events with phylogenomics and current species distribution, we find that killifish species distribution eludes species dispersal by tectonic drift only. Investigating the colonization of a non-annual killifish (Pachypanchax playfairii) on the Seychelle islands, we found genetic support for trans-oceanic dispersal and experimentally discovered an adaptation to complete tolerance to seawater. At the macroevolutionary scale, despite their long-lasting isolation, non-annual golden panchax show stronger genome-wide purifying selection than annual killifishes from continental Africa. However, progressive decline in effective population size in a more recent time-scale likely led to the segregation of slightly deleterious mutations across golden panchax populations, which represents a potential threat for species preservation on the long run.

%X IMPORTANCE: In clinical guidelines, overt and subclinical thyroid dysfunction are mentioned as causal and treatable factors for cognitive decline. However, the scientific literature on these associations shows inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVE: To assess cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of baseline thyroid dysfunction with cognitive function and dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicohort individual participant data analysis assessed 114 267 person-years (median, 1.7-11.3 years) of follow-up for cognitive function and 525 222 person-years (median, 3.8-15.3 years) for dementia between 1989 and 2017. Analyses on cognitive function included 21 cohorts comprising 38 144 participants. Analyses on dementia included eight cohorts with a total of 2033 cases with dementia and 44 573 controls. Data analysis was performed from December 2016 to January 2021. EXPOSURES: Thyroid function was classified as overt hyperthyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and overt hypothyroidism based on uniform thyrotropin cutoff values and study-specific free thyroxine values. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was global cognitive function, mostly measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Executive function, memory, and dementia were secondary outcomes. Analyses were first performed at study level using multivariable linear regression and multivariable Cox regression, respectively. The studies were combined with restricted maximum likelihood meta-analysis. To overcome the use of different scales, results were transformed to standardized mean differences. For incident dementia, hazard ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Among 74 565 total participants, 66 567 (89.3%) participants had normal thyroid function, 577 (0.8%) had overt hyperthyroidism, 2557 (3.4%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism, 4167 (5.6%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 697 (0.9%) had overt hypothyroidism. The study-specific median age at baseline varied from 57 to 93 years; 42 847 (57.5%) participants were women. Thyroid dysfunction was not associated with global cognitive function; the largest differences were observed between overt hypothyroidism and euthyroidism-cross-sectionally (-0.06 standardized mean difference in score; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.08; P = .40) and longitudinally (0.11 standardized mean difference higher decline per year; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.23; P = .09). No consistent associations were observed between thyroid dysfunction and executive function, memory, or risk of dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this individual participant data analysis of more than 74 000 adults, subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were not associated with cognitive function, cognitive decline, or incident dementia. No rigorous conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of overt thyroid dysfunction in risk of dementia. These findings do not support the practice of screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in the context of cognitive decline in older adults as recommended in current guidelines.

%X The highly conserved YrdC domain-containing protein (YRDC) interacts with the well-described KEOPS complex, regulating specific tRNA modifications to ensure accurate protein synthesis. Previous studies have linked the KEOPS complex to a role in promoting telomere maintenance and controlling genome integrity. Here, we report on a newborn with a severe neonatal progeroid phenotype including generalized loss of subcutaneous fat, microcephaly, growth retardation, wrinkled skin, renal failure, and premature death at the age of 12 days. By trio whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation, c.662T > C, in YRDC affecting an evolutionary highly conserved amino acid (p.Ile221Thr). Functional characterization of patient-derived dermal fibroblasts revealed that this mutation impairs YRDC function and consequently results in reduced t6A modifications of tRNAs. Furthermore, we established and performed a novel and highly sensitive 3-D Q-FISH analysis based on single-telomere detection to investigate the impact of YRDC on telomere maintenance. This analysis revealed significant telomere shortening in YRDC-mutant cells. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of YRDC-mutant fibroblasts revealed significant transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression, specifically enriched for genes associated with processes involved in DNA repair. We next examined the DNA damage response of patient’s dermal fibroblasts and detected an increased susceptibility to genotoxic agents and a global DNA double-strand break repair defect. Thus, our data suggest that YRDC may affect the maintenance of genomic stability. Together, our findings indicate that biallelic variants in YRDC result in a developmental disorder with progeroid features and might be linked to increased genomic instability and telomere shortening.

%X Stem cells are remarkably small. Whether small size is important for stem cell function is unknown. We find that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enlarge under conditions known to decrease stem cell function. This decreased fitness of large HSCs is due to reduced proliferation and was accompanied by altered metabolism. Preventing HSC enlargement or reducing large HSCs in size averts the loss of stem cell potential under conditions causing stem cell exhaustion. Last, we show that murine and human HSCs enlarge during aging. Preventing this age-dependent enlargement improves HSC function. We conclude that small cell size is important for stem cell function in vivo and propose that stem cell enlargement contributes to their functional decline during aging.

%X Reduced activity of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) increases healthy lifespan among diverse animal species. Downstream of IIS, multiple evolutionarily conserved transcription factors (TFs) are required; however, distinct TFs are likely responsible for these effects in different tissues. Here we have asked which TFs can extend healthy lifespan within distinct cell types of the adult nervous system in Drosophila Starting from published single-cell transcriptomic data, we report that forkhead (FKH) is endogenously expressed in neurons, whereas forkhead-box-O (FOXO) is expressed in glial cells. Accordingly, we find that neuronal FKH and glial FOXO exert independent prolongevity effects. We have further explored the role of neuronal FKH in a model of Alzheimer's disease-associated neuronal dysfunction, where we find that increased neuronal FKH preserves behavioral function and reduces ubiquitinated protein aggregation. Finally, using transcriptomic profiling, we identify Atg17, a member of the Atg1 autophagy initiation family, as one FKH-dependent target whose neuronal overexpression is sufficient to extend healthy lifespan. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of cell type-specific mapping of TF activity to preserve healthy function with age.

%X The study of metabolic changes associated with host-pathogen interactions have largely focused on the strategies that microbes use to subvert host metabolism to support their own proliferation. However, recent reports demonstrate that changes in host cell metabolism can also be detrimental to pathogens and restrict their growth. In this Review, I present a framework to consider how the host cell exploits the multifaceted roles of metabolites to defend against microbes. I also highlight how the rewiring of metabolic processes can strengthen cellular barriers to microbial invasion, regulate microbial virulence programs and factors, limit microbial access to nutrient sources and generate toxic environments for microbes. Collectively, the studies described here support a critical role for the rewiring of cellular metabolism in the defense against microbes. Further study of host-pathogen interactions from this framework has the potential to reveal novel aspects of host defense and metabolic control, and may inform how human metabolism impacts the progression of infectious disease.

%X Cytosolic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) elicits a type I interferon response, but signals triggering the release of mtDNA from mitochondria remain enigmatic. Here, we show that mtDNA-dependent immune signalling via the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase‒stimulator of interferon genes‒TANK-binding kinase 1 (cGAS–STING–TBK1) pathway is under metabolic control and is induced by cellular pyrimidine deficiency. The mitochondrial protease YME1L preserves pyrimidine pools by supporting de novo nucleotide synthesis and by proteolysis of the pyrimidine nucleotide carrier SLC25A33. Deficiency of YME1L causes inflammation in mouse retinas and in cultured cells. It drives the release of mtDNA and a cGAS–STING–TBK1-dependent inflammatory response, which requires SLC25A33 and is suppressed upon replenishment of cellular pyrimidine pools. Overexpression of SLC25A33 is sufficient to induce immune signalling by mtDNA. Similarly, depletion of cytosolic nucleotides upon inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis triggers mtDNA-dependent immune responses in wild-type cells. Our results thus identify mtDNA release and innate immune signalling as a metabolic response to cellular pyrimidine deficiencies.

%X Aging is accompanied by a general decline in the function of many cellular pathways. However, whether these are causally or functionally interconnected remains elusive. Here, we study the effect of mitochondrial–nuclear communication on stem cell aging. We show that aged mesenchymal stem cells exhibit reduced chromatin accessibility and lower histone acetylation, particularly on promoters and enhancers of osteogenic genes. The reduced histone acetylation is due to impaired export of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, owing to the lower levels of citrate carrier (CiC). We demonstrate that aged cells showed enhanced lysosomal degradation of CiC, which is mediated via mitochondrial-derived vesicles. Strikingly, restoring cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels either by exogenous CiC expression or via acetate supplementation, remodels the chromatin landscape and rescues the osteogenesis defects of aged mesenchymal stem cells. Collectively, our results establish a tight, age-dependent connection between mitochondrial quality control, chromatin and stem cell fate, which are linked together by CiC.

%X Potato is the third most important food crop in the world. Despite its social and economic importance, the autotetraploid genome of cultivated potato has not been assembled yet. The distinct reconstruction all of four haplotypes remained an unsolved challenge. Here, we report the 3.1 Gb haplotype-resolved, chromosome-scale assembly of the autotetraploid potato cultivar, Otava. We assembled the genome with high-quality long reads coupled with single-cell sequencing of 717 pollen genomes and chromosome conformation capture data at a haplotyping precision of 99.6%. Unexpectedly, we found that almost 50% of the tetraploid genome were identical-by-descent with at least one of the other haplotypes. This high level of inbreeding contrasted with the extreme level of structural rearrangements encompassing nearly 20% of the genome. Overall, we annotated 148,577 gene models, where only 54% of the genes were present in all four haplotypes with an average of 3.2 copies per gene. Our work showcases how accurate assemblies of complex and partially inbred autotetraploid genomes can be generated. The newly established resource gives novel insights in the breeding history of autotetraploid potato and has the potential to change the future of genomics-assisted potato breeding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

%X Age is a common risk factor in many diseases, but the molecular basis for this relationship is elusive. In this study we identified 4 disease clusters from 116 diseases in the UK Biobank data, defined by their age-of-onset profiles, and found that diseases with the same onset profile are genetically more similar, suggesting a common etiology. This similarity was not explained by disease categories, co-occurrences or disease cause-effect relationships. Two of the four disease clusters had an increased risk of occurrence from age 20 and 40 years respectively. They both showed an association with known aging-related genes, yet differed in functional enrichment and evolutionary profiles. Moreover, they both had age-related expression and methylation changes. We also tested mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy theories of aging and found support for both.

%X The recent rapid spread of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods has created a large variety of experimental and computational pipelines for which best practices have not yet been established. Here, we use simulations based on five scRNA-seq library protocols in combination with nine realistic differential expression (DE) setups to systematically evaluate three mapping, four imputation, seven normalisation and four differential expression testing approaches resulting in ~3000 pipelines, allowing us to also assess interactions among pipeline steps. We find that choices of normalisation and library preparation protocols have the biggest impact on scRNA-seq analyses. Specifically, we find that library preparation determines the ability to detect symmetric expression differences, while normalisation dominates pipeline performance in asymmetric DE-setups. Finally, we illustrate the importance of informed choices by showing that a good scRNA-seq pipeline can have the same impact on detecting a biological signal as quadrupling the sample size.

%X Macroautophagy, a key player in protein quality control, is proposed to be systematically impaired in distinct tissues and causes coordinated disruption of protein homeostasis and ageing throughout the body. Although tissue-specific changes in autophagy and ageing have been extensively explored, the mechanism underlying the inter-tissue regulation of autophagy with ageing is poorly understood. Here, we show that a secreted microRNA, mir-83/miR-29, controls the age-related decrease in macroautophagy across tissues in Caenorhabditis elegans. Upregulated in the intestine by hsf-1/HSF1 with age, mir-83 is transported across tissues potentially via extracellular vesicles and disrupts macroautophagy by suppressing CUP-5/MCOLN, a vital autophagy regulator, autonomously in the intestine as well as non-autonomously in body wall muscle. Mutating mir-83 thereby enhances macroautophagy in different tissues, promoting protein homeostasis and longevity. These findings thus identify a microRNA-based mechanism to coordinate the decreasing macroautophagy in various tissues with age.

%X Dietary restriction (DR) during adulthood can greatly extend lifespan and improve metabolic health in diverse species. However, whether DR in mammals is still effective when applied for the first time at old age remains elusive. Here, we report results of a late-life DR switch experiment employing 800 mice, in which 24 months old female mice were switched from ad libitum (AL) to DR or vice versa. Strikingly, the switch from DR-to-AL acutely increases mortality, whereas the switch from AL-to-DR causes only a weak and gradual increase in survival, suggesting a memory of earlier nutrition. RNA-seq profiling in liver, brown (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) demonstrate a largely refractory transcriptional and metabolic response to DR after AL feeding in fat tissue, particularly in WAT, and a proinflammatory signature in aged preadipocytes, which is prevented by chronic DR feeding. Our results provide evidence for a nutritional memory as a limiting factor for DR-induced longevity and metabolic remodeling of WAT in mammals.

%X Operating shared resource laboratories (SRLs) in times of pandemic is a challenge for research institutions. In a multiuser, high-turnover working space, the transmission of infectious agents is difficult to control. To address this challenge, imaging core facility managers being members of German BioImaging discussed how shared microscopes could be operated with minimal risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 between users and staff. Here, we describe the resulting guidelines and explain their rationale, with a focus on separating users in space and time, protective face masks, and keeping surfaces virus-free. These recommendations may prove useful for other types of SRLs. (c) 2020 The Authors.

%X The giant fiber system (GFS) is a multi-component neuronal pathway mediating rapid escape response in the adult fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster, usually in the face of a threatening visual stimulus. Two branches of the circuit promote the response by stimulating an escape jump followed by flight initiation. A recent work demonstrated an age-associated decline in the speed of signal propagation through the circuit, measured as the stimulus-to-muscle depolarization response latency. The decline is likely due to the diminishing number of inter-neuronal gap junctions in the GFS of ageing flies. In this work, we presented a realistic conductance-based, computational model of the GFS that recapitulates the experimental results and identifies some of the critical anatomical and physiological components governing the circuit's response latency. According to our model, anatomical properties of the GFS neurons have a stronger impact on the transmission than neuronal membrane conductance densities. The model provides testable predictions for the effect of experimental interventions on the circuit's performance in young and ageing flies.

%X Mitochondrial energy metabolism plays an important role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. Recently, a missense N437S variant was identified in the MRPP3 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial RNA processing enzyme within the RNase P complex, with predicted impact on metabolism. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce this variant into the mouse Mrpp3 gene and show that the variant causes insulin resistance on a high-fat diet. The variant did not influence mitochondrial gene expression markedly, but instead, it reduced mitochondrial calcium that lowered insulin release from the pancreatic islet β cells of the Mrpp3 variant mice. Reduced insulin secretion resulted in lower insulin levels that contributed to imbalanced metabolism and liver steatosis in the Mrpp3 variant mice on a high-fat diet. Our findings reveal that the MRPP3 variant may be a predisposing factor to insulin resistance and metabolic disease in the human population.

%X Intronic GGGGCC repeat expansions in C9orf72 are the most common known cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which are characterised by degeneration of cortical and motor neurons, respectively. Repeat expansions have been proposed to cause disease by both the repeat RNA forming foci that sequester RNA-binding proteins and through toxic dipeptide repeat proteins generated by repeat-associated non-ATG translation. GGGGCC repeat RNA folds into a G-quadruplex secondary structure, and we investigated whether targeting this structure is a potential therapeutic strategy. We performed a screen that identified three structurally related small molecules that specifically stabilise GGGGCC repeat G-quadruplex RNA We investigated their effect in C9orf72 patient iPSC-derived motor and cortical neurons and show that they significantly reduce RNA foci burden and the levels of dipeptide repeat proteins. Furthermore, they also reduce dipeptide repeat proteins and improve survival in vivo, in GGGGCC repeat-expressing Drosophila Therefore, small molecules that target GGGGCC repeat G-quadruplexes can ameliorate the two key pathologies associated with C9orf72 FTD/ALS These data provide proof of principle that targeting GGGGCC repeat G-quadruplexes has therapeutic potential.

%X Ageing is the largest risk factor for a variety of non-communicable diseases. Model organism studies have shown that genetic and chemical perturbations can extend both life- and health-span. Ageing is a complex process, with parallel and interacting mechanisms contributing to its aetiology, posing a challenge for the discovery of new pharmacological candidates to ameliorate its effects. In this study, instead of a target-centric approach, we adopt a systems level drug repurposing methodology to discover drugs that could combat ageing in human brain. Using multiple gene expression datasets from brain tissue, taken from patients of different ages, we first identified the expression changes that characterise ageing. Then, we compared these changes in gene expression with drug perturbed expression profiles in the Connectivity Map. We thus identified 24 drugs with significantly associated changes. Some of these drugs may function as anti-ageing drugs by reversing the detrimental changes that occur during ageing, others by mimicking the cellular defense mechanisms. The drugs that we identified included significant number of already identified pro-longevity drugs, indicating that the method can discover de novo drugs that meliorate ageing. The approach has the advantages that, by using data from human brain ageing data it focuses on processes relevant in human ageing and that it is unbiased, making it possible to discover new targets for ageing studies.

%X The insulin family of growth factors plays an important role in development and function of the nervous system. Reduced insulin and insulin-growth-factor signaling (IIS), however, can improve symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases in laboratory model organisms and protect against age-associated decline in neuronal function. Recently, we showed that chronic, moderately lowered IIS rescues age-related decline in neurotransmission through the Drosophila giant fiber escape response circuit. Here, we expand our initial findings by demonstrating that reduced functional output in the giant fiber system of aging flies can be prevented by increasing proteasomal activity within the circuit. Manipulations of IIS in neurons can also affect longevity, underscoring the relevance of the nervous system for aging.

%X Intermittent fasting (IF) can improve function and health during aging in laboratory model organisms, but the mechanisms at work await elucidation. We subjected fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to varying degrees of IF and found that just one month of a 2-day fed:5-day fasted IF regime at the beginning of adulthood was sufficient to extend lifespan. This long-lasting, beneficial effect of early IF was not due to reduced fecundity. Starvation resistance and resistance to oxidative and xenobiotic stress were increased after IF. Early-life IF also led to higher lipid content in 60-day-old flies, a potential explanation for increased longevity. Guts of flies 40 days post-IF showed a significant reduction in age-related pathologies and improved gut barrier function. Improved gut health was also associated with reduced relative bacterial abundance. Early IF thus induced profound long-term changes. Pharmacological and genetic epistasis analysis showed that IF acted independently of the TOR pathway because rapamycin and IF acted additively to extend lifespan, and global expression of a constitutively active S6K did not attenuate the IF-induced lifespan extension. We conclude that short-term IF during early life can induce long-lasting beneficial effects, with robust increase in lifespan in a TOR-independent manner, probably at least in part by preserving gut health.

%X Genetically modified mouse models of ageing are the living proof that lifespan and healthspan can be lengthened or shortened, and provide a powerful context in which to unravel the molecular mechanisms at work. In this study, we analysed and compared gene expression data from 10 long-lived and 8 short-lived mouse models of ageing. Transcriptome-wide correlation analysis revealed that mutations with equivalent effects on lifespan induce more similar transcriptomic changes, especially if they target the same pathway. Using functional enrichment analysis, we identified 58 gene sets with consistent changes in long- and short-lived mice, 55 of which were up-regulated in long-lived mice and down-regulated in short-lived mice. Half of these sets represented genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism, among which Ppargc1a, Mif, Aldh5a1 and Idh1 were frequently observed. Based on the gene sets with consistent changes, and also the whole transcriptome, the gene expression changes during normal ageing resembled the transcriptome of short-lived models, suggesting that accelerated ageing models reproduce partially the molecular changes of ageing. Finally, we identified new genetic interventions that may ameliorate ageing, by comparing the transcriptomes of 51 mouse mutants not previously associated with ageing to expression signatures of long- and short-lived mice and ageing-related changes.

%X Transposable elements (TEs) inflict numerous negative effects on health and fitness as they replicate by integrating into new regions of the host genome. Even though organisms employ powerful mechanisms to demobilize TEs, transposons gradually lose repression during aging. The rising TE activity causes genomic instability and was implicated in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation and the determination of lifespan. It is therefore conceivable that long-lived individuals have improved TE silencing mechanisms resulting in reduced TE expression relative to their shorter-lived counterparts and fewer genomic insertions. Here, we test this hypothesis by performing the first genome-wide analysis of TE insertions and expression in populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for longevity through late-life reproduction for 50-170 generations from four independent studies. Contrary to our expectation, TE families were generally more abundant in long-lived populations compared to non-selected controls. Although simulations showed that this was not expected under neutrality, we found little evidence for selection driving TE abundance differences. Additional RNA-seq analysis revealed a tendency for reducing TE expression in selected populations, which might be more important for lifespan than regulating genomic insertions. We further find limited evidence of parallel selection on genes related to TE regulation and transposition. However, telomeric TEs were genomically and transcriptionally more abundant in long-lived flies, suggesting improved telomere maintenance as a promising TE-mediated mechanism for prolonging lifespan. Our results provide a novel viewpoint indicating that reproduction at old age increases the opportunity of TEs to be passed on to the next generation with little impact on longevity.

%X Reduced activity of the insulin/IGF signalling network increases health during ageing in multiple species. Diverse and tissue-specific mechanisms drive the health improvement. Here, we performed tissue-specific transcriptional and proteomic profiling of long-lived Drosophila dilp2-3,5 mutants, and identified tissue-specific regulation of >3600 transcripts and >3700 proteins. Most expression changes were regulated post-transcriptionally in the fat body, and only in mutants infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria, Wolbachia pipientis, which increases their lifespan. Bioinformatic analysis identified reduced co-translational ER targeting of secreted and membrane-associated proteins and increased DNA damage/repair response proteins. Accordingly, age-related DNA damage and genome instability were lower in fat body of the mutant, and overexpression of a minichromosome maintenance protein subunit extended lifespan. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism showed altered expression in the mutant intestine, and gut-specific overexpression of a lysosomal mannosidase increased autophagy, gut homeostasis, and lifespan. These processes are candidates for combatting ageing-related decline in other organisms.

%X Age-related changes to histone levels are seen in many species. However, it is unclear whether changes to histone expression could be exploited to ameliorate the effects of ageing in multicellular organisms. Here we show that inhibition of mTORC1 by the lifespan-extending drug rapamycin increases expression of histones H3 and H4 post-transcriptionally, through eIF3-mediated translation. Elevated expression of H3/H4 in intestinal enterocytes in Drosophila alters chromatin organization, induces intestinal autophagy through transcriptional regulation, prevents age-related decline in the intestine. Importantly, it also mediates rapamycin-induced longevity and intestinal health. Histones H3/H4 regulate expression of an autophagy cargo adaptor Bchs (WDFY3 in mammals), increased expression of which in enterocytes mediates increased H3/H4-dependent healthy longevity. In mice, rapamycin treatment increases expression of histone proteins and Wdfy3 transcription, and alters chromatin organisation in the small intestine, suggesting the mTORC1-histone axis is at least partially conserved in mammals and may offer new targets for anti-ageing interventions.

%X Neurofilament light chain (NfL) has emerged as a promising blood biomarker for the progression of various neurological diseases. NfL is a structural protein of nerve cells, and elevated NfL levels in blood are thought to mirror damage to the nervous system. We find that plasma NfL levels increase in humans with age (n = 122; 21–107 years of age) and correlate with changes in other plasma proteins linked to neural pathways. In centenarians (n = 135), plasma NfL levels are associated with mortality equally or better than previously described multi-item scales of cognitive or physical functioning, and this observation was replicated in an independent cohort of nonagenarians (n = 180). Plasma NfL levels also increase in aging mice (n = 114; 2–30 months of age), and dietary restriction, a paradigm that extends lifespan in mice, attenuates the age-related increase in plasma NfL levels. These observations suggest a contribution of nervous system functional deterioration to late-life mortality.

%X Dietary restriction (DR) promotes healthy aging in diverse species. Essential amino acids play a key role, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. The evolutionarily conserved Sestrin protein, an inhibitor of activity of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), has recently been discovered as a sensor of amino acids in vitro. Here, we show that Sestrin null mutant flies have a blunted response of lifespan to DR. A mutant Sestrin fly line, with blocked amino acid binding and TORC1 activation, showed delayed development, reduced fecundity, extended lifespan and protection against lifespan-shortening, high-protein diets. Sestrin mediated reduced intestinal stem cell activity and gut cell turnover from DR, and stem cell proliferation in response to dietary amino acids, by regulating the TOR pathway and autophagy. Sestrin expression in intestinal stem cells was sufficient to maintain gut homeostasis and extend lifespan. Sestrin is thus a molecular link between dietary amino acids, stem cell function and longevity.

%X Mitochondria are the main site for generating reactive oxygen species, which are key players in diverse biological processes. However, the molecular pathways of redox signal transduction from the matrix to the cytosol are poorly defined. Here we report an inside-out redox signal of mitochondria. Cysteine oxidation of MIC60, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, triggers the formation of disulfide bonds and the physical association of MIC60 with Miro, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein. The oxidative structural change of this membrane-crossing complex ultimately elicits cellular responses that delay mitophagy, impair cellular respiration and cause oxidative stress. Blocking the MIC60-Miro interaction or reducing either protein, genetically or pharmacologically, extends lifespan and health-span of healthy fruit flies, and benefits multiple models of Parkinson's disease and Friedreich's ataxia. Our discovery provides a molecular basis for common treatment strategies against oxidative stress.

%X Lithium is a nutritional trace element, used clinically as an anti-depressant. Preclinically, lithium has neuroprotective effects in invertebrates and mice, and it can also extend lifespan in fission yeast, C. elegans and Drosophila. An inverse correlation of human mortality with the concentration of lithium in tap water suggests a possible, evolutionarily conserved mechanism mediating longevity. Here, we assessed the effects of lithium treatment on lifespan and ageing parameters in mice. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic dose range, and overdosing can severely affect organ health. Within the tolerable dosing range, we saw some mildly positive effects of lithium on health span but not on lifespan.

%X At first glance, longevity and immunity appear to be different traits that have not much in common except the fact that the immune system promotes survival upon pathogenic infection. Substantial evidence however points to a molecularly intertwined relationship between the immune system and ageing. Although this link is well-known throughout the animal kingdom, its genetic basis is complex and still poorly understood. To address this question, we here provide a compilation of all genes concomitantly known to be involved in immunity and ageing in humans and three well-studied model organisms, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the house mouse Mus musculus. By analysing human orthologs among these species, we identified 7 evolutionarily conserved signalling cascades, the insulin/TOR network, three MAPK (ERK, p38, JNK), JAK/STAT, TGF-beta, and Nf-kappaB pathways that act pleiotropically on ageing and immunity. We review current evidence for these pathways linking immunity and lifespan, and their role in the detrimental dysregulation of the immune system with age, known as immunosenescence. We argue that the phenotypic effects of these pathways are often context-dependent and vary, for example, between tissues, sexes, and types of pathogenic infection. Future research therefore needs to explore a higher temporal, spatial and environmental resolution to fully comprehend the connection between ageing and immunity.

%X Proteostasis collapses during aging resulting, among other things, in the accumulation of damaged and aggregated proteins. The proteasome is the main cellular proteolytic system and plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis. Our previous work has demonstrated that senescence and aging are related to a decline in proteasome content and activities, while its activation extends lifespan in vitro and in vivo in various species. However, the mechanisms underlying this age-related decline of proteasome function and the down-regulation in expression of its subunits remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the Forkhead box-O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor directly regulates the expression of a 20S proteasome catalytic subunit and, hence, proteasome activity. Specifically, we demonstrate that knockout of FoxO1, but not of FoxO3, in mice severely impairs proteasome activity in several tissues, while depletion of IRS1 enhances proteasome function. Importantly, we show that FoxO1 directly binds on the promoter region of the rate-limiting catalytic beta5 proteasome subunit to regulate its expression. In summary, this study reveals the direct role of FoxO factors in the regulation of proteasome function and provides new insight into how FoxOs affect proteostasis and, in turn, longevity.

%X G4C2 repeat expansions within the C9orf72 gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The repeats undergo repeat-associated non-ATG translation to generate toxic dipeptide repeat proteins. Here, we show that insulin/Igf signalling is reduced in fly models of C9orf72 repeat expansion using RNA-sequencing of adult brain. We further demonstrate that activation of insulin/Igf signalling can mitigate multiple neurodegenerative phenotypes in flies expressing either expanded G4C2 repeats or the toxic dipeptide repeat protein poly-GR. Levels of poly-GR are reduced when components of the insulin/Igf signalling pathway are genetically activated in the diseased flies, suggesting a mechanism of rescue. Modulating insulin signalling in mammalian cells also lowers poly-GR levels. Remarkably, systemic injection of insulin improves the survival of flies expressing G4C2 repeats. Overall, our data suggest that modulation of insulin/Igf signalling could be an effective therapeutic approach against C9orf72 ALS/FTD.

%X Reducing the burden of late-life morbidity requires an understanding of the mechanisms of ageing-related diseases (ARDs), defined as diseases that accumulate with increasing age. This has been hampered by the lack of formal criteria to identify ARDs. Here, we present a framework to identify ARDs using two complementary methods consisting of unsupervised machine learning and actuarial techniques, which we applied to electronic health records (EHRs) from 3,009,048 individuals in England using primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics admitted patient care dataset between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2015 (mean age 49.7 years (s.d. 18.6), 51% female, 70% white ethnicity). We grouped 278 high-burden diseases into nine main clusters according to their patterns of disease onset, using a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. Four of these clusters, encompassing 207 diseases spanning diverse organ systems and clinical specialties, had rates of disease onset that clearly increased with chronological age. However, the ages of onset for these four clusters were strikingly different, with median age of onset 82 years (IQR 82-83) for Cluster 1, 77 years (IQR 75-77) for Cluster 2, 69 years (IQR 66-71) for Cluster 3 and 57 years (IQR 54-59) for Cluster 4. Fitting to ageing-related actuarial models confirmed that the vast majority of these 207 diseases had a high probability of being ageing-related. Cardiovascular diseases and cancers were highly represented, while benign neoplastic, skin and psychiatric conditions were largely absent from the four ageing-related clusters. Our framework identifies and clusters ARDs and can form the basis for fundamental and translational research into ageing pathways.

%X Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations become more prevalent with age and are postulated to contribute to the ageing process. Point mutations of mtDNA have been suggested to originate from two main sources, i.e. replicative errors and oxidative damage, but the contribution of each of these processes is much discussed. To elucidate the origin of mtDNA mutations, we measured point mutation load in mice with deficient mitochondrial base-excision repair (BER) caused by knockout alleles preventing mitochondrial import of the DNA repair glycosylases OGG1 and MUTYH (Ogg1 dMTS, Mutyh dMTS). Surprisingly, we detected no increase in the mtDNA mutation load in old Ogg1 dMTS mice. As DNA repair is especially important in the germ line, we bred the BER deficient mice for five consecutive generations but found no increase in the mtDNA mutation load in these maternal lineages. To increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and oxidative damage, we bred the Ogg1 dMTS mice with tissue specific Sod2 knockout mice. Although increased superoxide levels caused a plethora of changes in mitochondrial function, we did not detect any changes in the mutation load of mtDNA or mtRNA. Our results show that the importance of oxidative damage as a contributor of mtDNA mutations should be re-evaluated.

%X We report a role for the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSB) in regulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication initiation in mammalian mitochondria. Transcription from the light-strand promoter (LSP) is required both for gene expression and for generating the RNA primers needed for initiation of mtDNA synthesis. In the absence of mtSSB, transcription from LSP is strongly up-regulated, but no replication primers are formed. Using deep sequencing in a mouse knockout model and biochemical reconstitution experiments with pure proteins, we find that mtSSB is necessary to restrict transcription initiation to optimize RNA primer formation at both origins of mtDNA replication. Last, we show that human pathological versions of mtSSB causing severe mitochondrial disease cannot efficiently support primer formation and initiation of mtDNA replication.

%X Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is compacting mitochondrial DNA (dmtDNA) into nucleoids and directly controls mtDNA copy number. Here, we show that the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio is critical for maintaining normal mtDNA expression in different mouse tissues. Moderately increased TFAM protein levels increase mtDNA copy number but a normal TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio is maintained resulting in unaltered mtDNA expression and normal whole animal metabolism. Mice ubiquitously expressing very high TFAM levels develop pathology leading to deficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and early postnatal lethality. The TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio varies widely between tissues in these mice and is very high in skeletal muscle leading to strong repression of mtDNA expression and OXPHOS deficiency. In the heart, increased mtDNA copy number results in a near normal TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio and maintained OXPHOS capacity. In liver, induction of LONP1 protease and mitochondrial RNA polymerase expression counteracts the silencing effect of high TFAM levels. TFAM thus acts as a general repressor of mtDNA expression and this effect can be counterbalanced by tissue-specific expression of regulatory factors.

%X The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle by converting pyruvate into acetyl-coenzyme A. PDHc encompasses three enzymatically active subunits, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase is a multidomain protein comprising a varying number of lipoyl domains, a peripheral subunit-binding domain, and a catalytic domain. It forms the structural core of the complex, provides binding sites for the other enzymes, and shuffles reaction intermediates between the active sites through covalently bound lipoyl domains. The molecular mechanism by which this shuttling occurs has remained elusive. Here, we report a cryo-EM reconstruction of the native E. coli dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core in a resting state. This structure provides molecular details of the assembly of the core and reveals how the lipoyl domains interact with the core at the active site.

%X Mitochondria are essential organelles containing approximately 1,500 proteins. Only approximately 1% of these proteins are synthesized inside mitochondria, whereas the remaining 99% are synthesized as precursors on cytosolic ribosomes and imported into the organelle. Various tools and techniques to analyze the import process have been developed. Among them, in vitro reconstituted import systems are of importance to study these processes in detail. These experiments monitor the import reaction of mitochondrial precursors that were previously radiolabeled in a cell-free environment. However, the methods described have been mostly performed in mitochondria isolated from S. cerevisiae. Here, we describe the adaptation of this powerful assay to import proteins into crude mitochondria isolated from human tissue culture cells.

%X Heart development relies on PTMs that control cardiomyocyte proliferation, differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis. We generated a map of phosphorylation sites during the early stages of cardiac postnatal development in mice; we quantified over 10,000 phosphorylation sites and 5000 proteins that were assigned to different pathways. Analysis of mitochondrial proteins led to the identification of PGC-1- and ERR-induced regulator in muscle 1 (PERM1), which is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissue and associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane. We demonstrate PERM1 is subject to rapid changes mediated by the UPS through phosphorylation of its PEST motif by casein kinase 2. Ablation of Perm1 in mice results in reduced protein expression of lipin-1 accompanied by accumulation of specific phospholipid species. Isolation of Perm1-deficient mitochondria revealed significant downregulation of mitochondrial transport proteins for amino acids and carnitines, including SLC25A12/13/29/34 and CPT2. Consistently, we observed altered levels of various lipid species, amino acids, and acylcarnitines in Perm1(-/-) mitochondria. We conclude that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein PERM1 regulates homeostasis of lipid and amino acid metabolites in mitochondria.

%X Wound healing is a coordinated process that initially relies on pro-inflammatory macrophages, followed by a pro-resolution function of these cells. Changes in cellular metabolism likely dictate these distinct activities, but the nature of these changes has been unclear. Here, we profiled early- versus late-stage skin wound macrophages in mice at both the transcriptional and functional levels. We found that glycolytic metabolism in the early phase is not sufficient to ensure productive repair. Instead, by combining conditional disruption of the electron transport chain with deletion of tgcqmitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, followed by single-cell sequencing analysis, we found that a subpopulation of early-stage wound macrophages are marked by mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production and HIF1alpha stabilization, which ultimately drives a pro-angiogenic program essential for timely healing. In contrast, late-phase, pro-resolving wound macrophages are marked by IL-4Ralpha-mediated mitochondrial respiration and mitohormesis. Collectively, we identify changes in mitochondrial metabolism as a critical control mechanism for macrophage effector functions during wound healing.

%X Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) are implicated in diverse physiological processes-for example, mitochondrial quality control-and are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. However, their specific cargo composition and complex molecular biogenesis are still unknown. Here we report the proteome and lipidome of steady-state TOMM20(+) MDVs. We identified 107 high-confidence MDV cargoes, which include all beta-barrel proteins and the TOM import complex. MDV cargoes are delivered as fully assembled complexes to lysosomes, thus representing a selective mitochondrial quality control mechanism for multi-subunit complexes, including the TOM machinery. Moreover, we define key biogenesis steps of phosphatidic acid-enriched MDVs starting with the MIRO1/2-dependent formation of thin membrane protrusions pulled along microtubule filaments, followed by MID49/MID51/MFF-dependent recruitment of the dynamin family GTPase DRP1 and finally DRP1-dependent scission. In summary, we define the function of MDVs in mitochondrial quality control and present a mechanistic model for global GTPase-driven MDV biogenesis.

%X Mitochondria are master regulators of metabolism and have emerged as key signalling organelles of the innate immune system. Each mitochondrion harbours potent agonists of inflammation, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which are normally shielded from the rest of the cell and extracellular environment and therefore do not elicit detrimental inflammatory cascades. Mitochondrial damage and dysfunction can lead to the cytosolic and extracellular exposure of mtDNA, which triggers inflammation in a number of diseases including autoimmune neurodegenerative disorders. However, recent research has revealed that the extra-mitochondrial exposure of mtDNA is not solely a negative consequence of mitochondrial damage and pointed to an active role of mitochondria in innate immunity. Metabolic cues including nucleotide imbalance can stimulate the release of mtDNA from mitochondria in order to drive a type I interferon response. Moreover, important effectors of the innate immune response to pathogen infection, such as the mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), are located at the mitochondrial surface and modulated by the cellular metabolic status and mitochondrial dynamics. In this review, we explore how and why metabolism and innate immunity converge at the mitochondria and describe how mitochondria orchestrate innate immune signalling pathways in different metabolic scenarios. Understanding how cellular metabolism and metabolic programming of mitochondria are translated into innate immune responses bears relevance to a broad range of human diseases including cancer.

%X In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the tumor stroma constitutes most of the cell mass and contributes to therapy resistance and progression. Here we show a hitherto unknown metabolic cooperation between pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and tumor cells through Interleukin 17B/Interleukin 17B receptor (IL-17B/IL-17RB) signaling. Tumor-derived IL-17B carrying extracellular vesicles (EVs) activated stromal PSCs and induced the expression of IL-17RB. PSCs increased oxidative phosphorylation while reducing mitochondrial turnover. PSCs activated tumor cells in a feedback loop. Tumor cells subsequently increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased glycolysis partially via IL-6. In vivo, IL-17RB overexpression in PSCs accelerated tumor growth in a co-injection xenograft mouse model. Our results demonstrate a tumor-to-stroma feedback loop increasing tumor metabolism to accelerate tumor growth under optimal nutritional conditions.

%X Mutations in OPA1 cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) as well as DOA+, a phenotype characterized by more severe neurological deficits. OPA1 deficiency causes mitochondrial fragmentation and also disrupts cristae, respiration, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance, and cell viability. It has not yet been established whether phenotypic severity can be modulated by genetic modifiers of OPA1. We screened the entire known mitochondrial proteome (1,531 genes) to identify genes that control mitochondrial morphology using a first-in-kind imaging pipeline. We identified 145 known and novel candidate genes whose depletion promoted elongation or fragmentation of the mitochondrial network in control fibroblasts and 91 in DOA+ patient fibroblasts that prevented mitochondrial fragmentation, including phosphatidyl glycerophosphate synthase (PGS1). PGS1 depletion reduces CL content in mitochondria and rebalances mitochondrial dynamics in OPA1-deficient fibroblasts by inhibiting mitochondrial fission, which improves defective respiration, but does not rescue mtDNA depletion, cristae dysmorphology, or apoptotic sensitivity. Our data reveal that the multifaceted roles of OPA1 in mitochondria can be functionally uncoupled by modulating mitochondrial lipid metabolism, providing novel insights into the cellular relevance of mitochondrial fragmentation.

%X For the biogenesis of mitochondria, hundreds of proteins need to be targeted from the cytosol into the various compartments of this organelle. The intramitochondrial targeting routes these proteins take to reach their respective location in the organelle are well understood. However, the early targeting processes, from cytosolic ribosomes to the membrane of the organelle, are still largely unknown. In this study, we present evidence that an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Ema19, plays a role in this process. Mutants lacking Ema19 show an increased stability of mitochondrial precursor proteins, indicating that Ema19 promotes the proteolytic degradation of non-productive precursors. The deletion of Ema19 improves the growth of respiration-deficient cells, suggesting that Ema19-mediated degradation can compete with productive protein import into mitochondria. Ema19 is the yeast representative of a conserved protein family. The human Ema19 homolog is known as sigma 2 receptor or TMEM97. Though its molecular function is not known, previous studies suggested a role of the sigma 2 receptor as a quality control factor in the ER, compatible with our observations about Ema19. More globally, our data provide an additional demonstration of the important role of the ER in mitochondrial protein targeting.

%X Lipid transfer proteins of the Ups1/PRELID1 family facilitate the transport of phospholipids across the intermembrane space of mitochondria in a lipid-specific manner. Heterodimeric complexes of yeast Ups1/Mdm35 or human PRELID1/TRIAP1 shuttle phosphatidic acid (PA) mainly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the inner membrane, where it is converted to cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondria. Loss of Ups1/PRELID1 proteins impairs the accumulation of CL and broadly affects mitochondrial structure and function. Unexpectedly and unlike yeast cells lacking the cardiolipin synthase Crd1, Ups1 deficient yeast cells exhibit glycolytic growth defects, pointing to functions of Ups1-mediated PA transfer beyond CL synthesis. Here, we show that the disturbed intramitochondrial transport of PA in ups1Delta cells leads to altered unfolded protein response (UPR) and mTORC1 signaling, independent of disturbances in CL synthesis. The impaired flux of PA into mitochondria is associated with the increased synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and a reduced phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/PC ratio in the ER of ups1Delta cells which suppresses the UPR. Moreover, we observed inhibition of TORC1 signaling in these cells. Activation of either UPR by ER protein stress or of TORC1 signaling by disruption of its negative regulator, the SEACIT complex, increased cytosolic protein synthesis and restored glycolytic growth of ups1Delta cells. These results demonstrate that PA influx into mitochondria is required to preserve ER membrane homeostasis and that its disturbance is associated with impaired glycolytic growth and cellular stress signaling.

%X Human mitochondria express a genome that encodes thirteen core subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). These proteins insert into the inner membrane co-translationally. Therefore, mitochondrial ribosomes engage with the OXA1L-insertase and membrane-associated proteins, which support membrane insertion of translation products and early assembly steps into OXPHOS complexes. To identify ribosome-associated biogenesis factors for the OXPHOS system, we purified ribosomes and associated proteins from mitochondria. We identified TMEM223 as a ribosome-associated protein involved in complex IV biogenesis. TMEM223 stimulates the translation of COX1 mRNA and is a constituent of early COX1 assembly intermediates. Moreover, we show that SMIM4 together with C12ORF73 interacts with newly synthesized cytochrome b to support initial steps of complex III biogenesis in complex with UQCC1 and UQCC2. Our analyses define the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosome and reveal novel assembly factors for complex III and IV biogenesis that link early assembly stages to the translation machinery.

%X Identification of protein complexes and quantitative distribution of a single protein across different complexes are fundamental to unravel cellular mechanisms and of biological and clinical relevance. A recently introduced method, complexome profiling, combines fractionation techniques to separate native protein complexes with high-resolution mass spectrometry and allows to identify protein complexes in an unbiased manner. Due to recent advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation, the analysis time can be reduced dramatically while the coverage of thousands of proteins remains constant, which leads to an increased data acquisition rate and reduces the burden to initiate such complex experiments. Therefore, the development of novel computational pipelines for the analysis of such comprehensive complexome profiles is required. Usually, potential complex formations are assembled by correlation analysis. However, a major challenge in such an analysis is, that a protein can occur in multiple complexes of varying composition. Hence, signal profiles of proteins of the same complex might show high local similarities but do correlate poorly over all acquired fractions. Here, we describe ComplexFinder; a python-based computational pipeline that enables machine-learning based prediction of novel protein-protein interactions incorporating numerous measures of distance between signal profiles. Importantly, each signal profile is represented by an ensemble of peak-like models. These models allow the calculation of local similarities, enabling peak-centric comparison between biological conditions and the estimation of the composition of specific complexes. From the predicted protein-protein interactions, a protein connectivity network is constructed, which is used to assemble proteins into macromolecular complexes incorporating peak-centric information. ComplexFinder enables the analysis of various types of complexome profiling experiment types including label-free, SILAC, and TMT experiments as well as pulseSILAC experiments in a peak-centric manner.

%X Innate immunity is the first line of defense against infections. Pathways regulating innate responses can also modulate other processes, including stress resistance and longevity. Increasing evidence suggests a role for the nucleolus in regulating cellular processes implicated in health and disease. Here we show the highly conserved nucleolar protein, fibrillarin, is a vital factor regulating pathogen resistance. Fibrillarin knockdown enhances resistance in C. elegans against bacterial pathogens, higher levels of fibrillarin induce susceptibility to infection. Pathogenic infection reduces nucleolar size, ribsosomal RNA, and fibrillarin levels. Genetic epistasis reveals fibrillarin functions independently of the major innate immunity mediators, suggesting novel mechanisms of pathogen resistance. Bacterial infection also reduces nucleolar size and fibrillarin levels in mammalian cells. Fibrillarin knockdown prior to infection increases intracellular bacterial clearance, reduces inflammation, and enhances cell survival. Collectively, these findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved role of fibrillarin in infection resistance and suggest the nucleolus as a focal point in innate immune responses.

%X The nucleolus is a prominent membraneless organelle residing within the nucleus. The nucleolus has been regarded as a housekeeping structure mainly known for its role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) production and ribosome assembly. However, accumulating evidence has revealed its functions in numerous cellular processes that control organismal physiology, thereby taking the nucleolus much beyond its conventional role in ribosome biogenesis. Perturbations in nucleolar functions have been associated with severe diseases such as cancer and progeria. Recent studies have also uncovered the role of the nucleolus in development and aging. In this review we discuss major nucleolar functions that impact organismal aging.

%X An increasing aging population poses a significant challenge to societies worldwide. A better understanding of the molecular, cellular, organ, tissue, physiological, psychological, and even sociological changes that occur with aging is needed in order to treat age-associated diseases. The field of aging research is rapidly expanding with multiple advances transpiring in many previously disconnected areas. Several major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer companies made aging research a priority and are building internal expertise, integrating aging research into traditional business models and exploring new go-to-market strategies. Many of these efforts are spearheaded by the latest advances in artificial intelligence, namely deep learning, including generative and reinforcement learning. To facilitate these trends, the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Copenhagen and Insilico Medicine are building a community of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in these areas and launched the annual conference series titled "Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD)" held in the capital of the pharmaceutical industry, Basel, Switzerland (www.agingpharma.org). This ARDD collection contains summaries from the 6(th) annual meeting that explored aging mechanisms and new interventions in age-associated diseases. The 7(th) annual ARDD exhibition will transpire 2(nd)-4(th) of September, 2020, in Basel.

%X Over the last decade, the African turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri, has emerged as an important model system for the study of vertebrate biology and ageing. Propagation of laboratory inbred strains of Nothobranchius furzeri, such as GRZ, however, can pose challenges due to the short window of fertility, the efforts and space requirements involved in continuous strain maintenance, and the risks of further inbreeding. The current method for long term strain preservation relies on arrest of embryos in diapause. To create an alternative for long term maintenance, we developed a robust protocol to cryopreserve and revive sperm for in vitro fertilization (IVF). We tested a variety of extender and activator buffers for sperm IVF, as well as cryoprotectants to achieve practical long-term storage and fertilization conditions tailored to this species. Our protocol enabled sperm to be preserved in a cryogenic condition for months and to be revived with an average of 40% viability upon thawing. Thawed sperm were able to fertilize nearly the same number of eggs as natural fertilization, with an average of ~ 25% and peaks of ~ 55% fertilization. This technical advance will greatly facilitate the use of N. furzeri as a model organism.

%X The metabolome represents a complex network of biological events that reflects the physiologic state of the organism in health and disease. Additionally, specific metabolites and metabolic signaling pathways have been shown to modulate animal ageing, but whether there are convergent mechanisms uniting these processes remains elusive. Here, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to obtain the metabolomic profiles of canonical longevity pathways in C. elegans to identify metabolites regulating life span. By leveraging the metabolomic profiles across pathways, we found that one carbon metabolism and the folate cycle are pervasively regulated in common. We observed similar changes in long-lived mouse models of reduced insulin/IGF signaling. Genetic manipulation of pathway enzymes and supplementation with one carbon metabolites in C. elegans reveal that regulation of the folate cycle represents a shared causal mechanism of longevity and proteoprotection. Such interventions impact the methionine cycle, and reveal methionine restriction as an underlying mechanism. This comparative approach reveals key metabolic nodes to enhance healthy ageing.

%X Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness due to mutations in the dystrophin gene. The symptoms of DMD share similarities with those of accelerated aging. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) supplementation has been suggested to modulate the effects of age-related decline in muscle function, and metabolic H2S deficiencies have been implicated in affecting muscle mass in conditions such as phenylketonuria. We therefore evaluated the use of sodium GYY4137 (NaGYY), a H2S-releasing molecule, as a possible approach for DMD treatment. Using the dys-1(eg33) Caenorhabditis elegans DMD model, we found that NaGYY treatment (100 microM) improved movement, strength, gait, and muscle mitochondrial structure, similar to the gold-standard therapeutic treatment, prednisone (370 microM). The health improvements of either treatment required the action of the kinase JNK-1, the transcription factor SKN-1, and the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIR-2.1. The transcription factor DAF-16 was required for the health benefits of NaGYY treatment, but not prednisone treatment. AP39 (100 pM), a mitochondria-targeted H2S compound, also improved movement and strength in the dys-1(eg33) model, further implying that these improvements are mitochondria-based. Additionally, we found a decline in total sulfide and H2S-producing enzymes in dystrophin/utrophin knockout mice. Overall, our results suggest that H2S deficit may contribute to DMD pathology, and rectifying/overcoming the deficit with H2S delivery compounds has potential as a therapeutic approach to DMD treatment.

%X Muscle function relies on the precise architecture of dynamic contractile elements, which must be fine-tuned to maintain motility throughout life. Muscle is also plastic, and remodeled in response to stress, growth, neural and metabolic inputs. The conserved muscle-enriched microRNA, miR-1, regulates distinct aspects of muscle development, but whether it plays a role during aging is unknown. Here we investigated Caenorhabditis elegans miR-1 in muscle function in response to proteostatic stress. mir-1 deletion improved mid-life muscle motility, pharyngeal pumping, and organismal longevity upon polyQ35 proteotoxic challenge. We identified multiple vacuolar ATPase subunits as subject to miR-1 control, and the regulatory subunit vha-13/ATP6V1A as a direct target downregulated via its 3'UTR to mediate miR-1 physiology. miR-1 further regulates nuclear localization of lysosomal biogenesis factor HLH-30/TFEB and lysosomal acidification. Our studies reveal that miR-1 coordinately regulates lysosomal v-ATPase and biogenesis to impact muscle function and health during aging.

%X Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) are key secondary messenger molecules produced by cyclic dinucleotide synthases that trigger various cellular signaling cascades from bacteria to vertebrates. In mammals, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has been shown to bind to intracellular DNA and catalyze the production of the dinucleotide 2'3' cGAMP, which signals downstream effectors to regulate immune function, interferon signaling, and the antiviral response. Despite the importance of CDNs, sensitive and accurate methods to measure their levels in vivo are lacking. Here, we report a novel LC-MS/MS method to quantify CDNs in vivo. We characterized the mass spectrometric behavior of four different biologically relevant CDNs (c-di-AMP, c-di-GMP, 3'3' cGAMP, 2'3' cGAMP) and provided a means of visually representing fragmentation resulting from collision-induced dissociation at different energies using collision energy breakdown graphs. We then validated the method and quantified CDNs in two in vivo systems, the bacteria Escherichia coli OP50 and the killifish Nothobranchius furzeri. We found that optimization of LC-MS/MS parameters is crucial to sensitivity and accuracy. These technical advances should help illuminate physiological and pathological roles of these CDNs in in vivo settings. Graphical abstract.

%X Invading microbes occupy the host cytosol and take up nutrients on which host organelles are also dependent. Thus, host organelles are poised to interact with intracellular microbes. Despite the essential role of host mitochondria in cellular metabolic homeostasis and in mediating cellular responses to microbial infection, we know little of how these organelles interact with intracellular pathogens, and how such interactions affect disease pathogenesis. Here, we give an overview of the different classes of physical and metabolic interactions reported to occur between mitochondria and eukaryotic pathogens. Investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms and functions of such interactions will reveal novel aspects of infection biology.

%X Mitochondrial disorders make up a large class of heritable diseases that cause a broad array of different human pathologies. They can affect many different organ systems, or display very specific tissue presentation, and can lead to illness either in childhood or later in life. While the over 1200 genes encoded in the nuclear DNA play an important role in human mitochondrial disease, it has been known for over 30 years that mutations of the mitochondria's own small, multicopy DNA chromosome (mtDNA) can lead to heritable human diseases. Unfortunately, animal mtDNA has resisted transgenic and directed genome editing technologies until quite recently. As such, animal models to aid in our understanding of these diseases, and to explore preclinical therapeutic research have been quite rare. This review will discuss the unusual properties of animal mitochondria that have hindered the generation of animal models. It will also discuss the existing mammalian models of human mtDNA disease, describe the methods employed in their generation, and will discuss recent advances in the targeting of DNA-manipulating enzymes to the mitochondria and how these may be employed to generate new models.

%X BACKGROUND: Insulin is the key regulator of glucose metabolism, but it is difficult to dissect direct insulin from glucose-induced effects. We aimed to investigate the effects of hyperinsulemia on metabolomic measures under euglycemic conditions in nondiabetic participants. METHODS: We assessed concentrations of 151 metabolomic measures throughout a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure. We included 24 participants (50% women, mean age = 62 [s.d. = 4.2] years) and metabolomic measures were assessed under baseline, low-dose (10 mU/m(2)/min) and high-dose (40 mU/m(2)/min) insulin conditions. The effects of low- and high-dose insulin infusion on metabolomic measures were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models for repeated measures. RESULTS: After low-dose insulin infusion, 90 metabolomic measures changed in concentration (p < 1.34e(-4)), among which glycerol (beta [Confidence Interval] = - 1.41 [- 1.54, - 1.27] s.d., p = 1.28e(-95)) and three-hydroxybutyrate (- 1.22 [- 1.36, - 1.07] s.d., p = 1.44e(-61)) showed largest effect sizes. After high-dose insulin infusion, 121 metabolomic measures changed in concentration, among which branched-chain amino acids showed the largest additional decrease compared with low-dose insulin infusion (e.g., Leucine, - 1.78 [- 1.88, - 1.69] s.d., P = 2.7e(-295)). More specifically, after low- and high-dose insulin infusion, the distribution of the lipoproteins shifted towards more LDL-sized particles with decreased mean diameters. CONCLUSION: Metabolomic measures are differentially insulin sensitive and may thus be differentially affected by the development of insulin resistance. Moreover, our data suggests insulin directly affects metabolomic measures previously associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk.

%X Ageing is accompanied by loss of tissue integrity and organismal homeostasis partly due to decline in stem cell function. The age-associated decrease in stem cell abundance and activity is often referred to as stem cell exhaustion and is considered one major hallmark of ageing. Importantly, stem cell proliferation and differentiation potential are tightly coupled to the cellular epigenetic state. Thus, research during the last years has started to investigate how the epigenome regulates stem cell function upon ageing. Here, we summarize the role of epigenetic regulation in stem cell fate decisions and we review the impact of age-related changes of the epigenome on stem cell activity. Finally, we discuss how targeted interventions on the epigenetic landscape might delay ageing and extend health-span.

%X Contrary to the long-held view that most humans harbour only identical mitochondrial genomes, deep resequencing has uncovered unanticipated extreme genetic variation within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Most, if not all, humans contain multiple mtDNA genotypes (heteroplasmy); specific patterns of variants accumulate in different tissues, including cancers, over time; and some variants are preferentially passed down or suppressed in the maternal germ line. These findings cast light on the origin and spread of mtDNA mutations at multiple scales, from the organelle to the human population, and challenge the conventional view that high percentages of a mutation are required before a new variant has functional consequences.

%X Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine with both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties with a heritability estimate of up to 61%. The circulating levels of IL-6 in blood have been associated with an increased risk of complex disease pathogenesis. We conducted a two-staged, discovery, and replication meta genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating serum IL-6 levels comprising up to 67 428 (ndiscovery = 52 654 and nreplication = 14 774) individuals of European ancestry. The inverse variance fixed-effects based discovery meta-analysis, followed by replication led to the identification of two independent loci, IL1F10/IL1RN rs6734238 on Chromosome (Chr) 2q14, (pcombined = 1.8 x 10-11), HLA-DRB1/DRB5 rs660895 on Chr6p21 (pcombined = 1.5 x 10-10) in the combined meta-analyses of all samples. We also replicated the IL6R rs4537545 locus on Chr1q21 (pcombined = 1.2 x 10-122). Our study identifies novel loci for circulating IL-6 levels uncovering new immunological and inflammatory pathways that may influence IL-6 pathobiology.

%X Cellular adaptation to stress is a crucial homeostatic process for survival, metabolism, physiology, and disease. Cells respond to stress stimuli (e.g., nutrient starvation, growth factor deprivation, hypoxia, low energy, etc.) by changing the activity of signaling pathways, and interact with their environment by qualitatively and quantitatively modifying their intracellular, surface, and extracellular proteomes. How this delicate communication takes place is a hot topic in cell biological research, and has important implications for human disease.

%X The development of complex stratified epithelial barriers in mammals is initiated from single-layered epithelia. How stratification is initiated and fueled are still open questions. Previous studies on skin epidermal stratification suggested a central role for perpendicular/asymmetric cell division orientation of the basal keratinocyte progenitors. Here, we use centrosomes, that organize the mitotic spindle, to test whether cell division orientation and stratification are linked. Genetically ablating centrosomes from the developing epidermis leads to the activation of the p53-, 53BP1- and USP28-dependent mitotic surveillance pathway causing a thinner epidermis and hair follicle arrest. The centrosome/p53-double mutant keratinocyte progenitors significantly alter their division orientation in the later stages without majorly affecting epidermal differentiation. Together with time-lapse imaging and tissue growth dynamics measurements, the data suggest that the first and major phase of epidermal development is boosted by high proliferation rates in both basal and suprabasally-committed keratinocytes as well as cell delamination, whereas the second phase maybe uncoupled from the division orientation of the basal progenitors. The data provide insights for tissue homeostasis and hyperproliferative diseases that may recapitulate developmental programs.

%X Some mutations in the tRNA genes of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been demonstrated to affect the processing of the mitochondrial transcriptome in human patients with mitochondrial disease. A recent analysis of mtDNA mutations in 527 human tumors revealed that approximately a quarter of the somatic mt-tRNA gene mutations lead to aberrant processing of the mitochondrial transcriptome in these tumors. Here, we describe a method, based on mtDNA mutations induced by the mtDNA mutator mouse, to map the sites that lead to transcript processing abnormalities. Mutations in the mtDNA are identified and quantified by amplicon-based mtDNA sequencing, and compared to the allelic ratios observed in matched RNASeq data. Strong deviation in the variant allele frequencies between the amplicon and RNASeq data suggests that such mutations lead to disruptions in mitochondrial transcript processing.

%X BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest interconnections between thyroid status, metabolism, and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), but causality remains to be proven. The present study aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship between thyroid status and cardiovascular disease and to characterize the metabolomic profile associated with thyroid status. METHODS: Multi-cohort two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed utilizing genome-wide significant variants as instruments for standardized thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) within the reference range. Associations between TSH and fT4 and metabolic profile were investigated in a two-stage manner: associations between TSH and fT4 and the full panel of 161 metabolomic markers were first assessed hypothesis-free, then directional consistency was assessed through Mendelian randomization, another metabolic profile platform, and in individuals with biochemically defined thyroid dysfunction. RESULTS: Circulating TSH was associated with 52/161 metabolomic markers, and fT4 levels were associated with 21/161 metabolomic markers among 9432 euthyroid individuals (median age varied from 23.0 to 75.4 years, 54.5% women). Positive associations between circulating TSH levels and concentrations of very low-density lipoprotein subclasses and components, triglycerides, and triglyceride content of lipoproteins were directionally consistent across the multivariable regression, MR, metabolomic platforms, and for individuals with hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Associations with fT4 levels inversely reflected those observed with TSH. Among 91,810 CAD cases and 656,091 controls of European ancestry, per 1-SD increase of genetically determined TSH concentration risk of CAD increased slightly, but not significantly, with an OR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.99-1.07; p value 0.16), whereas higher genetically determined fT4 levels were not associated with CAD risk (OR 1.00 per SD increase of fT4; 95% CI 0.96-1.04; p value 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Lower thyroid status leads to an unfavorable lipid profile and a somewhat increased cardiovascular disease risk.

%X Aberrant function of epigenetic modifiers plays an important role not only in the progression of cancer but also the development of drug resistance. N-alpha-acetyltransferase 40 (NAA40) is a highly specific epigenetic enzyme catalyzing the transfer of an acetyl moiety at the N-terminal end of histones H4 and H2A. Recent studies have illustrated the essential oncogenic role of NAA40 in various cancer types but its role in chemoresistance remains unclear. Here, using transcriptomic followed by metabolomic analysis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, we demonstrate that NAA40 controls key one-carbon metabolic genes and corresponding metabolites. In particular, through its acetyltransferase activity NAA40 regulates the methionine cycle thereby affecting global histone methylation and CRC cell survival. Importantly, NAA40-mediated metabolic rewiring promotes resistance of CRC cells to antimetabolite chemotherapy in vitro and in xenograft models. Specifically, NAA40 stimulates transcription of the one-carbon metabolic gene thymidylate synthase (TYMS), whose product is targeted by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and accordingly in primary CRC tumours NAA40 expression associates with TYMS levels and poorer 5-FU response. Mechanistically, NAA40 activates TYMS by preventing enrichment of repressive H2A/H4S1ph at the nuclear periphery. Overall, these findings define a novel regulatory link between epigenetics and cellular metabolism mediated by NAA40, which is harnessed by cancer cells to evade chemotherapy.

%X Human mitoribosomes are macromolecular complexes essential for translation of 11 mitochondrial mRNAs. The large and the small mitoribosomal subunits undergo a multistep maturation process that requires the involvement of several factors. Among these factors, GTP-binding proteins (GTPBPs) play an important role as GTP hydrolysis can provide energy throughout the assembly stages. In bacteria, many GTPBPs are needed for the maturation of ribosome subunits and, of particular interest for this study, ObgE has been shown to assist in the 50S subunit assembly. Here, we characterize the role of a related human Obg-family member, GTPBP5. We show that GTPBP5 interacts specifically with the large mitoribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) proteins and several late-stage mitoribosome assembly factors, including MTERF4:NSUN4 complex, MRM2 methyltransferase, MALSU1 and MTG1. Interestingly, we find that interaction of GTPBP5 with the mt-LSU is compromised in the presence of a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP, implying a different mechanism of action of this protein in contrast to that of other Obg-family GTPBPs. GTPBP5 ablation leads to severe impairment in the oxidative phosphorylation system, concurrent with a decrease in mitochondrial translation and reduced monosome formation. Overall, our data indicate an important role of GTPBP5 in mitochondrial function and suggest its involvement in the late-stage of mt-LSU maturation.

%X Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) synthesize a small subset of proteins, which are essential components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Therefore, their function is of fundamental importance to cellular metabolism. The assembly of mitoribosomes is a complex process that progresses through numerous maturation and protein-binding events coordinated by the actions of several assembly factors. Dysregulation of mitoribosome production is increasingly recognized as a contributor to metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, mutations in multiple components of the mitoribosome assembly machinery have been associated with a range of human pathologies, highlighting their importance to cell function and health. Here, we provide a review of our current understanding of mitoribosome biogenesis, highlighting the key factors involved in this process and the growing number of mutations in genes encoding mitoribosomal RNAs, proteins, and assembly factors that lead to human disease.

%X Hereditary spastic paraplegias are heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms remains sparse, and therapeutic options are lacking. We characterized a mouse model lacking the Cyp2u1 gene, loss of which is known to be involved in a complex form of these diseases in humans. We showed that this model partially recapitulated the clinical and biochemical phenotypes of patients. Using electron microscopy, lipidomic, and proteomic studies, we identified vitamin B2 as a substrate of the CYP2U1 enzyme, as well as coenzyme Q, neopterin, and IFN-alpha levels as putative biomarkers in mice and fluids obtained from the largest series of CYP2U1-mutated patients reported so far. We also confirmed brain calcifications as a potential biomarker in patients. Our results suggest that CYP2U1 deficiency disrupts mitochondrial function and impacts proper neurodevelopment, which could be prevented by folate supplementation in our mouse model, followed by a neurodegenerative process altering multiple neuronal and extraneuronal tissues.

%X Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) resist current glioblastoma (GBM) therapies. GSCs rely highly on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whose function requires mitochondrial translation. Here we explore the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial translation and report the results of high-content screening with putative blockers of mitochondrial ribosomes. We identify the bacterial antibiotic quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) as an effective suppressor of GSC growth. Q/D also decreases the clonogenicity of GSCs in vitro, consequently dysregulating the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that Q/D binds to the large mitoribosomal subunit, inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis and functionally dysregulating OXPHOS complexes. These data suggest that targeting mitochondrial translation could be explored to therapeutically suppress GSC growth in GBM and that Q/D could potentially be repurposed for cancer treatment.

%X BACKGROUND: Sleep traits are associated with cardiometabolic disease risk, with evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) suggesting that insomnia symptoms and shorter sleep duration increase coronary artery disease risk. We combined adjusted multivariable regression (AMV) and MR analyses of phenotypes of unfavourable sleep on 113 metabolomic traits to investigate possible biochemical mechanisms linking sleep to cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We used AMV (N = 17,368) combined with two-sample MR (N = 38,618) to examine effects of self-reported insomnia symptoms, total habitual sleep duration, and chronotype on 113 metabolomic traits. The AMV analyses were conducted on data from 10 cohorts of mostly Europeans, adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index. For the MR analyses, we used summary results from published European-ancestry genome-wide association studies of self-reported sleep traits and of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) serum metabolites. We used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and complemented this with sensitivity analyses to assess MR assumptions. RESULTS: We found consistent evidence from AMV and MR analyses for associations of usual vs. sometimes/rare/never insomnia symptoms with lower citrate (- 0.08 standard deviation (SD)[95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.12, - 0.03] in AMV and - 0.03SD [- 0.07, - 0.003] in MR), higher glycoprotein acetyls (0.08SD [95% CI 0.03, 0.12] in AMV and 0.06SD [0.03, 0.10) in MR]), lower total very large HDL particles (- 0.04SD [- 0.08, 0.00] in AMV and - 0.05SD [- 0.09, - 0.02] in MR), and lower phospholipids in very large HDL particles (- 0.04SD [- 0.08, 0.002] in AMV and - 0.05SD [- 0.08, - 0.02] in MR). Longer total sleep duration associated with higher creatinine concentrations using both methods (0.02SD per 1 h [0.01, 0.03] in AMV and 0.15SD [0.02, 0.29] in MR) and with isoleucine in MR analyses (0.22SD [0.08, 0.35]). No consistent evidence was observed for effects of chronotype on metabolomic measures. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst our results suggested that unfavourable sleep traits may not cause widespread metabolic disruption, some notable effects were observed. The evidence for possible effects of insomnia symptoms on glycoprotein acetyls and citrate and longer total sleep duration on creatinine and isoleucine might explain some of the effects, found in MR analyses of these sleep traits on coronary heart disease, which warrant further investigation.

%X Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches can enable detection and quantification of many thousands of metabolite features simultaneously. However, compound identification and reliable quantification are greatly complicated owing to the chemical complexity and dynamic range of the metabolome. Simultaneous quantification of many metabolites within complex mixtures can additionally be complicated by ion suppression, fragmentation and the presence of isomers. Here we present guidelines covering sample preparation, replication and randomization, quantification, recovery and recombination, ion suppression and peak misidentification, as a means to enable high-quality reporting of liquid chromatography- and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics-derived data.

Despite the profound knowledge of sex pheromones, little is known about the coevolutionary mechanisms and constraints on their production and detection. Using whole-genome sequences to infer the kinship among 99 drosophilids, we investigate how phylogenetic and chemical traits have interacted at a wide evolutionary timescale. Through a series of chemical syntheses and electrophysiological recordings, we identify 52 sex-specific compounds, many of which are detected via olfaction. Behavioral analyses reveal that many of the 43 male-specific compounds are transferred to the female during copulation and mediate female receptivity and/or male courtship inhibition. Measurement of phylogenetic signals demonstrates that sex pheromones and their cognate olfactory channels evolve rapidly and independently over evolutionary time to guarantee efficient intra- and inter-specific communication systems. Our results show how sexual isolation barriers between species can be reinforced by species-specific olfactory signals.

%X Innate immunity triggers responsible for viral control or hyperinflammation in COVID-19 are largely unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) primes inflammasome formation and release of mature interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in macrophages derived from COVID-19 patients but not in macrophages from healthy SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses reveal robust S-protein-driven inflammasome activation in macrophages isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients, which correlates with distinct epigenetic and gene expression signatures suggesting innate immune memory after recovery from COVID-19. Importantly, we show that S-protein-driven IL-1β secretion from patient-derived macrophages requires non-specific monocyte pre-activation in vivo to trigger NLRP3-inflammasome signaling. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes profound and long-lived reprogramming of macrophages resulting in augmented immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, a major vaccine antigen and potent driver of adaptive and innate immune signaling.

%X Biomarkers of low-grade inflammation have been associated with susceptibility to a severe infectious disease course, even when measured prior to disease onset. We investigated whether metabolic biomarkers measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy could be associated with susceptibility to severe pneumonia (2507 hospitalised or fatal cases) and severe COVID-19 (652 hospitalised cases) in 105,146 generally healthy individuals from UK Biobank, with blood samples collected 2007-2010. The overall signature of metabolic biomarker associations was similar for the risk of severe pneumonia and severe COVID-19. A multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 proteins, fatty acids, amino acids, and lipids, was associated equally strongly with enhanced susceptibility to severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 2.9 [95%CI 2.1-3.8] for highest vs lowest quintile) and severe pneumonia events occurring 7-11 years after blood sampling (2.6 [1.7-3.9]). However, the risk for severe pneumonia occurring during the first 2 years after blood sampling for people with elevated levels of the multi-biomarker score was over four times higher than for long-term risk (8.0 [4.1-15.6]). If these hypothesis generating findings on increased susceptibility to severe pneumonia during the first few years after blood sampling extend to severe COVID-19, metabolic biomarker profiling could potentially complement existing tools for identifying individuals at high risk. These results provide novel molecular understanding on how metabolic biomarkers reflect the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and other infections in the general population.<br>National policies for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic include stricter measures for people considered to be at high risk of severe and potentially fatal cases of the disease. Although older age and pre-existing health conditions are strong risk factors, it is poorly understood why susceptibility varies so widely in the population. People with cardiometabolic diseases, such as diabetes and liver diseases, or chronic inflammation are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and other infections including pneumonia. These conditions alter the molecules circulating in the blood, providing potential ‘biomarkers’ to determine whether a person is more likely to develop a fatal infection. Uncovering these blood biomarkers could help to identify people who are prone to life-threatening infections despite not having ever been diagnosed with a cardiometabolic disease. To find these biomarkers, Julkunen et al. studied blood samples that had been collected from 105,000 healthy individuals in the United Kingdom over ten years ago. The data showed that individuals with biomarkers linked to low-grade inflammation and cardiometabolic disease were more likely to have died or been hospitalised with pneumonia. A score based on 25 of these biomarkers provided the best predictor of severe pneumonia. This biomarker score performed up to four times better within the first few years after blood sampling compared to predicting cases of pneumonia a decade later. The same blood biomarker changes were also linked with developing severe COVID-19 over ten years after the blood samples had been collected. The predictive value of the biomarker score was similar for both severe COVID-19 and the long-term risk of severe pneumonia. Julkunen et al. propose that the metabolic biomarkers reflect inhibited immunity that impairs response to infections. The results from over 100,000 individuals suggest that these blood biomarkers may help to identify people at high risk of severe COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.<br>eng

%X Bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) proliferation and lineage commitment are under the coordinated control of metabolism and epigenetics; the MSC niche contains low oxygen, which is an important determinant of the cellular metabolic state. In turn, metabolism drives stem cell fate decisions via alterations of the chromatin landscape. Due to the fundamental role of BM-MSCs in the development of adipose tissue, bones and cartilage, age-associated changes in metabolism and the epigenome perturb the balance between stem cell proliferation and differentiation leading to stem cell depletion, fat accumulation and bone-quality related diseases. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the metabolism-chromatin interplay is crucial for maintaining the stem cell pool and delaying the development and progression of ageing. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of metabolism in stem cell identity and highlights the impact of the metabolic inputs on the epigenome, with regards to stemness and pluripotency.

%X Diseases caused by heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA mutations have no effective treatment or cure. In recent years, DNA editing enzymes were tested as tools to eliminate mutant mtDNA in heteroplasmic cells and tissues. Mitochondrial-targeted restriction endonucleases, ZFNs, and TALENs have been successful in shifting mtDNA heteroplasmy, but they all have drawbacks as gene therapy reagents, including: large size, heterodimeric nature, inability to distinguish single base changes, or low flexibility and effectiveness. Here we report the adaptation of a gene editing platform based on the I-CreI meganuclease known as ARCUS((R)). These mitochondrial-targeted meganucleases (mitoARCUS) have a relatively small size, are monomeric, and can recognize sequences differing by as little as one base pair. We show the development of a mitoARCUS specific for the mouse m.5024C>T mutation in the mt-tRNA(Ala) gene and its delivery to mice intravenously using AAV9 as a vector. Liver and skeletal muscle show robust elimination of mutant mtDNA with concomitant restoration of mt-tRNA(Ala) levels. We conclude that mitoARCUS is a potential powerful tool for the elimination of mutant mtDNA.

%X Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) is a technique that allows genome-wide, quantitative analysis of translation. In recent years, it has found multiple applications in studies of translation in diverse organisms, tracking protein synthesis with single codon resolution. Traditional protocols applied for generating Ribo-Seq libraries from mammalian cell cultures are not suitable to study mitochondrial translation due to differences between eukaryotic cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomes. Here, we present an adapted protocol enriching for mitoribosome footprints. In addition, we describe the preparation of small RNA sequencing libraries from the resultant mitochondrial ribosomal protected fragments (mtRPFs).

%X A modern day light microscope has evolved from a tool devoted to making primarily empirical observations to what is now a sophisticated, quantitative device that is an integral part of both physical and life science research. Nowadays, microscopes are found in nearly every experimental laboratory. However, despite their prevalent use in capturing and quantifying scientific phenomena, neither a thorough understanding of the principles underlying quantitative imaging techniques nor appropriate knowledge of how to calibrate, operate and maintain microscopes can be taken for granted. This is clearly demonstrated by the well-documented and widespread difficulties that are routinely encountered in evaluating acquired data and reproducing scientific experiments. Indeed, studies have shown that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to repeat another scientist's experiments, while more than half have even failed to reproduce their own experiments(1) . One factor behind the reproducibility crisis of experiments published in scientific journals is the frequent underreporting of imaging methods caused by a lack of awareness and/or a lack of knowledge of the applied technique(2,3) . Whereas quality control procedures for some methods used in biomedical research, such as genomics (e.g., DNA sequencing, RNA-seq) or cytometry, have been introduced (e.g. ENCODE(4) ), this issue has not been tackled for optical microscopy instrumentation and images. Although many calibration standards and protocols have been published, there is a lack of awareness and agreement on common standards and guidelines for quality assessment and reproducibility(5) . In April 2020, the QUality Assessment and REProducibility for instruments and images in Light Microscopy (QUAREP-LiMi) initiative(6) was formed. This initiative comprises imaging scientists from academia and industry who share a common interest in achieving a better understanding of the performance and limitations of microscopes and improved quality control (QC) in light microscopy. The ultimate goal of the QUAREP-LiMi initiative is to establish a set of common QC standards, guidelines, metadata models(7,8) , and tools(9,10) , including detailed protocols, with the ultimate aim of improving reproducible advances in scientific research. This White Paper 1) summarizes the major obstacles identified in the field that motivated the launch of the QUAREP-LiMi initiative; 2) identifies the urgent need to address these obstacles in a grassroots manner, through a community of stakeholders including, researchers, imaging scientists(11) , bioimage analysts, bioimage informatics developers, corporate partners, funding agencies, standards organizations, scientific publishers, and observers of such; 3) outlines the current actions of the QUAREP-LiMi initiative, and 4) proposes future steps that can be taken to improve the dissemination and acceptance of the proposed guidelines to manage QC. To summarize, the principal goal of the QUAREP-LiMi initiative is to improve the overall quality and reproducibility of light microscope image data by introducing broadly accepted standard practices and accurately captured image data metrics.

%X DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic DNA lesions. To protect genomic stability and ensure cell homeostasis, cells mount a complex signaling-based response that not only coordinates the repair of the broken DNA strand but also activates cell cycle checkpoints and, if necessary, induces cell death. The last decade has seen a flurry of studies that have identified RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) as novel regulators of the DSB response. While many of these RBPs have well-characterized roles in gene expression, it is becoming increasingly clear that they also have non-canonical functions in the DSB response that go well beyond transcription, splicing and mRNA processing. Here, we review the current understanding of how RBPs are integrated into the cellular response to DSBs and describe how these proteins directly participate in signal transduction, amplification and repair at damaged chromatin. In addition, we discuss the implications of an RBP-mediated DSB response for genome instability and age-associated diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration.

%X Ribosome biogenesis is an essential cellular process that requires integration of extracellular cues, such as metabolic state, with intracellular signalling, transcriptional regulation and chromatin accessibility at the ribosomal DNA. Here, we demonstrate that the recently identified histone modification, methylation of H2AQ105 (H2AQ105me), is an integral part of a dynamic chromatin network at the rDNA locus. Its deposition depends on a functional mTor signalling pathway and acetylation of histone H3 at position K56, thus integrating metabolic and proliferative signals. Furthermore, we identify a first epigenetic reader of this modification, the ribonucleoprotein Nhp2, which specifically recognizes H2AQ105me. Based on functional and proteomic data, we suggest that Nhp2 functions as an adapter to bridge rDNA chromatin with components of the small subunit processome to efficiently coordinate transcription of rRNA with its post-transcriptional processing. We support this by showing that an H2AQ105A mutant has a mild defect in early processing of rRNA.

%X Longevity is often associated with stress resistance, but whether they are causally linked is incompletely understood. Here we investigate chemosensory defective Caenorhabditis elegans mutants that are long-lived and stress resistant. We find that mutants in the intraflagellar transport protein gene osm-3 were significantly protected from tunicamycin-induced ER stress. While osm-3 lifespan extension is dependent on the key longevity factor DAF-16/FOXO, tunicamycin resistance was not. osm-3 mutants are protected from bacterial pathogens, which is pmk-1 p38 MAP kinase dependent while TM resistance was pmk-1 independent. Expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP) xenobiotic detoxification genes was elevated in osm-3 mutants and their knockdown or inhibition with verapamil suppressed tunicamycin resistance. The nuclear hormone receptor nhr-8 was necessary to regulate a subset of PGPs. We thus identify a cell-nonautonomous regulation of xenobiotic detoxification and show that separate pathways are engaged to mediate longevity, pathogen resistance, and xenobiotic detoxification in osm-3 mutants.

%X Induction of the one-carbon cycle is an early hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer metabolism. Vital intermediary steps are localized to mitochondria, but it remains unclear how one-carbon availability connects to mitochondrial function. Here, we show that the one-carbon metabolite and methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is pivotal for energy metabolism. A gradual decline in mitochondrial SAM (mitoSAM) causes hierarchical defects in fly and mouse, comprising loss of mitoSAM-dependent metabolites and impaired assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Complex I stability and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis are directly controlled by mitoSAM levels, while other protein targets are predominantly methylated outside of the organelle before import. The mitoSAM pool follows its cytosolic production, establishing mitochondria as responsive receivers of one-carbon units. Thus, we demonstrate that cellular methylation potential is required for energy metabolism, with direct relevance for pathophysiology, aging, and cancer.

%X Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance and have previously been shown to up-regulate the expression of the P2Y purinoreceptor 6 (P2Y6R) upon high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Here, we reveal that NK cell-specific inactivation of the P2Y6R gene improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice and reduces the expression of chemokines in adipose tissue infiltrating NK-cells. Obese mice lacking P2Y6R specifically in NK cells exhibited a reduction in adipose tissue inflammation, exhibited improved insulin-stimulated suppression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and a reduction in hepatic glucose production, leading to an overall improvement of systemic insulin sensitivity. In contrast, myeloid lineage specific P2Y6R inactivation does not affect energy or glucose homeostasis in obesity. Collectively, we show that P2Y6R signaling in NK cells contributes to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance and thus might be a future target for the treatment of obesity-associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.µCTMicro computer tomographyAgRPAgouti-related proteinAKTProtein kinase BApoa5Apolipoprotein A-VATPAdenosine triphosphateBATBrown adipose tissueBMDMBone marrow-derived macrophagesCcl3Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3Ccl4Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4CDControl DietCLSCrown-like structurescNKconventional NK cellsCxcl16Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 16DAGDiacylglyceridesDNDouble negativeECARExtracellular acidification rateOCROxygen consumption rateELISAEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assayERKExtracellular signal-regulated kinasesFFAFree fatty acidsGIRGlucose infusion rateGTTGlucose tolerance testHFDHigh fat dietHGPHepatic glucose productionHOMA-IRHomeostasis model assessment- insulin resistanceHSLHormone-sensitive lipaseIFNγInterferon gammaILInterleukinILCInnate lymphoid cellITTInsulin tolerance testLilra5Leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor A5LplLipoprotein lipaseMAPKMitogen-activated protein kinaseNCDNormal chow dietNK cellNatural killer cellOCROxygen consumption rateOXPHOSOxidative phosphorylationP2Y6RP2Y purinoreceptor 6PGATPerigonodal adipose tissuepHSLphosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipasePI3KPhosphoinositide 3-kinasePKCProtein kinase CPlin2Perilipin 2RERRespiratory exchange rateRoraRAR-related orphan receptor alphaSEMStandard error of the meanSKMSkeletal muscleSVFStromal vascular fractionTGTriglyceridesTNFαTumor necrosis factor alphaTPMTranscripts per milliontrNKtissue-resident NK cellsUDPUridine diphosphateuNKuterine NK cellsXcl1Chemokine (C motif) ligand

%X Healthy aging requires the coordination of numerous stress signaling pathways that converge on the protein homeostasis network. The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is activated by diverse stimuli, leading to phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor elF2 in its alpha-subunit. Under replete conditions, elF2 orchestrates 5' cap-dependent mRNA translation and is thus responsible for general protein synthesis. elF2alpha phosphorylation, the key event of the ISR, reduces global mRNA translation while enhancing the expression of a signature set of stress response genes. Despite the critical role of protein quality control in healthy aging and in numerous longevity pathways, the role of the ISR in longevity remains largely unexplored. ISR activity increases with age, suggesting a potential link with the aging process. Although decreased protein biosynthesis, which occurs during ISR activation, have been linked to lifespan extension, recent data show that lifespan is limited by the ISR as its inhibition extends survival in nematodes and enhances cognitive function in aged mice. Here we survey how aging affects the ISR, the role of the ISR in modulating aging, and pharmacological interventions to tune the ISR. Finally, we will explore the ISR as a plausible target for clinical interventions in aging and age-related disease.

%X The hexosamine pathway (HP) is a key anabolic pathway whose product uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is an essential precursor for glycosylation processes in mammals. It modulates the ER stress response and HP activation extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. The highly conserved glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 1 (GFAT-1) is the rate-limiting HP enzyme. GFAT-1 activity is modulated by UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition and via phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). Molecular consequences of GFAT-1 phosphorylation, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the GFAT-1 R203H substitution that elevates UDP-GlcNAc levels in C. elegans. In human GFAT-1, the R203H substitution interferes with UDP-GlcNAc inhibition and with PKA-mediated Ser205 phosphorylation. Our data indicate that phosphorylation affects the interactions of the two GFAT-1 domains to control catalytic activity. Notably, Ser205 phosphorylation has two discernible effects: it lowers baseline GFAT-1 activity and abolishes UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition. PKA controls the HP by uncoupling the metabolic feedback loop of GFAT-1.

%X Cytochrome c oxidase is a pivotal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which sustains bioenergetics of eukaryotic cells. Cox12, a peripheral subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, is required for full activity of the enzyme, but its exact function is unknown. Here, experimental evolution of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Δcox12 strain for ~300 generations allowed to restore the activity of cytochrome c oxidase. In one population, the enhanced bioenergetics was caused by a A375V mutation in the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104. Deletion or overexpression of Hsp104 also increased respiration of the Δcox12 ancestor strain. This beneficial effect of Hsp104 was related to the loss of the [PSI+] prion, which forms cytosolic amyloid aggregates of the Sup35 protein. Overall, our data demonstrate that cytosolic aggregation of a prion impairs the mitochondrial metabolism of cells defective for Cox12. These findings identify a new functional connection between cytosolic proteostasis and biogenesis of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

Herein, we describe the preparation of a holidic medium that allows stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in fruit flies (SILAF). Furthermore, in this chapter, we provide a protocol for mitochondrial enrichments from Drosophila larvae and flies together with a procedure to generate high-quality peptides for further analysis by mass spectrometry. Samples obtained following this protocol can be used for various functional studies such as comprehensive proteome profiling or quantitative analysis of posttranslational modifications upon enrichment. SILAF is based on standard fly routines in a basic wet lab environment and provides a flexible and cost-effective tool for quantitative protein expression analysis.

%X We analyze the metabolomes of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques in muscle, kidney and three different regions of the brain. Although several compounds in amino acid metabolism occur at either higher or lower concentrations in humans than in the other primates, metabolites downstream of adenylosuccinate lyase, which catalyzes two reactions in purine synthesis, occur at lower concentrations in humans. This enzyme carries an amino acid substitution that is present in all humans today but absent in Neandertals. By introducing the modern human substitution into the genomes of mice, as well as the ancestral, Neandertal-like substitution into the genomes of human cells, we show that this amino acid substitution contributes to much or all of the reduction of de novo synthesis of purines in humans.

%X Resistance to standard cisplatin-based chemotherapies leads to worse survival outcomes for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the aberrant mechanisms driving resistance in ESCC tumors. We hypothesized that ubiquilin-4 (UBQLN4), a protein that targets ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, regulates the expression of Meiotic Recombination 11 Homolog A (MRE11A), a critical component of the MRN complex and DNA damage repair pathways. Initially, immunohistochemistry analysis was conducted in specimens from patients with ESCC (n = 120). In endoscopic core ESCC biopsies taken from 61 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) (5-fluorouracil and cisplatin), low MRE11A and high UBQLN4 protein levels were associated with reduced pathological response to NAC (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariable analysis of surgically resected ESCC tissues from 59 patients revealed low MRE11A and high UBLQN4 expression as independent factors that can predict shorter overall survival [P = 0.01, hazard ratio (HR) = 5.11, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.45-18.03; P = 0.02, HR = 3.74, 95% CI, 1.19-11.76, respectively]. Suppression of MRE11A expression was associated with cisplatin resistance in ESCC cell lines. Additionally, MRE11A was found to be ubiquitinated after cisplatin treatment. We observed an amplification of UBQLN4 gene copy numbers and an increase in UBQLN4 protein levels in ESCC tissues. Binding of UBQLN4 to ubiquitinated-MRE11A increased MRE11A degradation, thereby regulating MRE11A protein levels following DNA damage and promoting cisplatin resistance. In summary, MRE11A and UBQLN4 protein levels can serve as predictors for NAC response and as prognostic markers in ESCC patients.

%X Gene expression involves regulation of chromatin structure and transcription, as well as processing of the transcribed mRNA. While there are feedback mechanisms, it is not clear whether these include crosstalk between chromatin architecture and mRNA decay. To address this, we performed a genome-wide genetic screen using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain harbouring the H3K56A mutation, which is known to perturb chromatin structure and nascent transcription. We identified Puf5 (also known as Mpt5) as essential in an H3K56A background. Depletion of Puf5 in this background leads to downregulation of Puf5 targets. We suggest that Puf5 plays a role in post-transcriptional buffering of mRNAs, and support this by transcriptional shutoff experiments in which Puf5 mRNA targets are degraded slower in H3K56A cells compared to wild-type cells. Finally, we show that post-transcriptional buffering of Puf5 targets is widespread and does not occur only in an H3K56A mutant, but also in an H3K4R background, which leads to a global increase in nascent transcription. Our data suggest that Puf5 determines the fate of its mRNA targets in a context-dependent manner acting as an mRNA surveillance hub balancing deregulated nascent transcription to maintain physiological mRNA levels.

%X Viruses manipulate cellular metabolism and macromolecule recycling processes like autophagy. Dysregulated metabolism might lead to excessive inflammatory and autoimmune responses as observed in severe and long COVID-19 patients. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 modulates cellular metabolism and reduces autophagy. Accordingly, compound-driven induction of autophagy limits SARS-CoV-2 propagation. In detail, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells show accumulation of key metabolites, activation of autophagy inhibitors (AKT1, SKP2) and reduction of proteins responsible for autophagy initiation (AMPK, TSC2, ULK1), membrane nucleation, and phagophore formation (BECN1, VPS34, ATG14), as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion (BECN1, ATG14 oligomers). Consequently, phagophore-incorporated autophagy markers LC3B-II and P62 accumulate, which we confirm in a hamster model and lung samples of COVID-19 patients. Single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing of patient-derived lung and mucosal samples show differential transcriptional regulation of autophagy and immune genes depending on cell type, disease duration, and SARS-CoV-2 replication levels. Targeting of autophagic pathways by exogenous administration of the polyamines spermidine and spermine, the selective AKT1 inhibitor MK-2206, and the BECN1-stabilizing anthelmintic drug niclosamide inhibit SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro with IC50 values of 136.7, 7.67, 0.11, and 0.13 muM, respectively. Autophagy-inducing compounds reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation in primary human lung cells and intestinal organoids emphasizing their potential as treatment options against COVID-19.

%X Drosophila melanogaster has been a workhorse of genetics and cell biology for more than a century. However, proteomic-based methods have been limited due to the complexity and dynamic range of the fly proteome and the lack of efficient labeling methods. Here, we advanced a chemically defined food source into direct stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in flies (SILAF). It allows for the rapid and cost-efficient generation of a large number of larvae or flies, with full incorporation of lysine-[(13)C6] after six labeling days. SILAF followed by fractionation and enrichment gave proteomic insights at a depth of 7196 proteins and 8451 phosphorylation sites, which substantiated metabolic regulation on enzymatic level. We applied SILAF to quantify the mitochondrial phosphoproteome of an early-stage leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein (LRPPRC)-knockdown fly model of mitochondrial disease that almost exclusively affects protein levels of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. While the mitochondrial compartment was hypo-phosphorylated, two conserved phosphosites on OXPHOS subunits NDUFB10 and NDUFA4 were significantly upregulated upon impaired OXPHOS function. The ease and versatility of the method actuate the fruit fly as an appealing model in proteomic and posttranslational modification studies, and it enlarges potential metabolic applications based on heavy amino acid diets.

%X Nowadays identification and quantification of proteins from biological samples by mass spectrometry are widely used. For the identification of proteins, there are two scenarios. Proteins are either pre-fractionated in some way, e.g., by gel electrophoresis or chromatography, or analyzed as complex mixture (shotgun). Because of technological developments of mass spectrometry, the identification of several thousand proteins from complex biological matrix becomes possible. However, in many cases, it is still useful to separate proteins first in a gel. For quantifying proteins, label-free, isotopic labeling, and data-independent acquisition (DIA) library are widely used. Not only mass spectrometry technology made progress. This is also true for the sample preparation. Protocols and techniques developed recently not only make the analysis of starting material in the low microgram range possible but also simplify the whole procedure. Here, we will describe some detailed protocols of preparing samples for mass spectrometry-based protein identification and protein quantification, as in-gel digestion, in-solution digestion, peptide cleaning, and TMT labeling. This will allow also inexperienced beginners to get good results.

%X In plant ecology, biochemical analyses of bryophytes and vascular plants are often conducted on dried herbarium specimen as species typically grow in distant and inaccessible locations. Here, we present an automated in silico compound classification framework to annotate metabolites using an untargeted data independent acquisition (DIA)-LC/MS-QToF-sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH) ecometabolomics analytical method. We perform a comparative investigation of the chemical diversity at the global level and the composition of metabolite families in ten different species of bryophytes using fresh samples collected on-site and dried specimen stored in a herbarium for half a year. Shannon and Pielou's diversity indices, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA), distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA), ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test, and the Fisher's exact test were used to determine differences in the richness and composition of metabolite families, with regard to herbarium conditions, ecological characteristics, and species. We functionally annotated metabolite families to biochemical processes related to the structural integrity of membranes and cell walls (proto-lignin, glycerophospholipids, carbohydrates), chemical defense (polyphenols, steroids), reactive oxygen species (ROS) protection (alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids), nutrition (nitrogen- and phosphate-containing glycerophospholipids), and photosynthesis. Changes in the composition of metabolite families also explained variance related to ecological functioning like physiological adaptations of bryophytes to dry environments (proteins, peptides, flavonoids, terpenes), light availability (flavonoids, terpenes, carbohydrates), temperature (flavonoids), and biotic interactions (steroids, terpenes). The results from this study allow to construct chemical traits that can be attributed to biogeochemistry, habitat conditions, environmental changes and biotic interactions. Our classification framework accelerates the complex annotation process in metabolomics and can be used to simplify biochemical patterns. We show that compound classification is a powerful tool that allows to explore relationships in both molecular biology by "zooming in" and in ecology by "zooming out". The insights revealed by our framework allow to construct new research hypotheses and to enable detailed follow-up studies.

%X Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the leading technique for characterizing the transcriptomes of individual cells in a sample. The latest protocols are scalable to thousands of cells and are being used to compile cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. However, the protocols differ substantially with respect to their RNA capture efficiency, bias, scale and costs, and their relative advantages for different applications are unclear. In the present study, we generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate protocols in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multicenter study comparing 13 commonly used scRNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols applied to a heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative analysis revealed marked differences in protocol performance. The protocols differed in library complexity and their ability to detect cell-type markers, impacting their predictive value and suitability for integration into reference cell atlases. These results provide guidance both for individual researchers and for consortium projects such as the Human Cell Atlas.

%X Core Facilities (CF) for advanced light microscopy (ALM) have become indispensable support units for research in the life sciences. Their organizational structure and technical characteristics are quite diverse, although the tasks they pursue and the services they offer are similar. Therefore, throughout Europe, scientists from ALM-CFs are forming networks to promote interactions and discuss best practice models. Here, we present recommendations for ALM-CF operations elaborated by the workgroups of the German network of ALM-CFs, German Bio-Imaging (GerBI). We address technical aspects of CF planning and instrument maintainance, give advice on the organization and management of an ALM-CF, propose a scheme for the training of CF users, and provide an overview of current resources for image processing and analysis. Further, we elaborate on the new challenges and opportunities for professional development and careers created by CFs. While some information specifically refers to the German academic system, most of the content of this article is of general interest for CFs in the life sciences. Microsc. Res.

%X Adaptation of liver to the postprandial state requires coordinated regulation of protein synthesis and folding aligned with changes in lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that sensory food perception is sufficient to elicit early activation of hepatic mTOR signaling, Xbp1 splicing, increased expression of ER-stress genes, and phosphatidylcholine synthesis, which translate into a rapid morphological ER remodeling. These responses overlap with those activated during refeeding, where they are maintained and constantly increased upon nutrient supply. Sensory food perception activates POMC neurons in the hypothalamus, optogenetic activation of POMC neurons activates hepatic mTOR signaling and Xbp1 splicing, whereas lack of MC4R expression attenuates these responses to sensory food perception. Chemogenetic POMC-neuron activation promotes sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) subserving the liver, and norepinephrine evokes the same responses in hepatocytes in vitro and in liver in vivo as observed upon sensory food perception. Collectively, our experiments unravel that sensory food perception coordinately primes postprandial liver ER adaption through a melanocortin-SNA-mTOR-Xbp1s axis. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

%X Microglial cells as innate immune key players have a critical and unique role in neurodegenerative disorders. They strongly interact with their microenvironment in a complex manner and react to changes by switching their phenotype and functional activation states. In order to understand the development of brain diseases, it is imperative to elucidate up- or down-regulation of genes involved in microglia polarisation in time-profile by a simple-to-use strategy. Here, we present a new imaging strategy to follow promoter activity of genes involved in microglia polarisation. We lentivirally transduced BV-2 microglia cells in culture with constructs consisting of the induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Fc gamma receptor III (Fcgr3) (both resembling the pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype) or Chitinase-like 3 (Chil3/Ym1) (resembling the anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype) promoters and stimulated transgenic cells with potent activators for pro- or anti-inflammatory response, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) or interleukin (IL)-4, respectively. Promoter activities upon polarisation phases were quantitatively assessed by the two imaging reporters Luc2 for bioluminescence and eGFP for fluorescence.

%X Serine ADP-ribosylation (Ser-ADPr) is a recently discovered protein modification that is catalyzed by PARP1 and PARP2 when in complex with the eponymous histone PARylation factor 1 (HPF1). In addition to numerous other targets, core histone tails are primary acceptors of Ser-ADPr in the DNA damage response. Here, we show that specific canonical histone marks interfere with Ser-ADPr of neighboring residues and vice versa. Most notably, acetylation, but not methylation of H3K9, is mutually exclusive with ADPr of H3S10 in vitro and in vivo. We also broaden the O-linked ADPr spectrum by providing evidence for tyrosine ADPr on HPF1 and other proteins. Finally, we facilitate wider investigations into the interplay of histone marks with Ser-ADPr by introducing a simple approach for profiling posttranslationally modified peptides. Our findings implicate Ser-ADPr as a dynamic addition to the complex interplay of modifications that shape the histone code.

%X The development of husbandry practices in non-model laboratory fish used for experimental purposes has greatly benefited from the establishment of reference fish model systems, such as zebrafish and medaka. In recent years, an emerging fish - the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) - has been adopted by a growing number of research groups in the fields of biology of aging and ecology. With a captive life span of 4 - 8 months, this species is the shortest-lived vertebrate raised in captivity and allows the scientific community to test - in a short time - experimental interventions that can lead to alterations of the aging rate and life expectancy. Given the unique biology of this species, characterized by embryonic diapause, explosive sexual maturation, marked morphological and behavioral sexual dimorphism - and their relatively short adult life span - ad hoc husbandry practices are in urgent demand. This protocol reports a set of key husbandry measures that allow optimal turquoise killifish laboratory care, enabling the scientific community to adopt this species as a powerful laboratory animal model.

%X Lipid droplets are conserved specialized organelles that store neutral lipids. Our view on this unique organelle has evolved from a simple fat deposit to a highly dynamic and functionally diverse hub-one that mediates the buffering of fatty acid stress and the adaptive reshaping of lipid metabolism to promote membrane and organelle homeostasis and the integrity of central proteostasis pathways, including autophagy, which ensure stress resistance and cell survival. This Review will summarize the recent developments in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as this model organism has been instrumental in deciphering the fundamental mechanisms and principles of lipid droplet biology and interconnecting lipid droplets with many unanticipated cellular functions applicable to many other cell systems.

%X Mitochondria contain tens to thousands of copies of their own genome (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA]), creating genetic redundancy capable of buffering mutations in mitochondrial genes essential for cellular function. However, the mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number have been elusive. Here we found that DNA synthesis and degradation by mtDNA polymerase gamma (POLG) dynamically controlled mtDNA copy number in starving yeast cells dependent on metabolic homeostasis provided by autophagy. Specifically, the continuous mtDNA synthesis by POLG in starving wild-type cells was inhibited by nucleotide insufficiency and elevated mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species in the presence of autophagy dysfunction. Moreover, after prolonged starvation, 3'-5' exonuclease-dependent mtDNA degradation by POLG adjusted the initially increasing mtDNA copy number in wild-type cells, but caused quantitative mtDNA instability and irreversible respiratory dysfunction in autophagy-deficient cells as a result of nucleotide limitations. In summary, our study reveals that mitochondria rely on the homeostatic functions of autophagy to balance synthetic and degradative modes of POLG, which control copy number dynamics and stability of the mitochondrial genome.

%X TGFB1 (transforming growth factor beta 1) is a potent cytokine playing a driving role in development, fibrosis and cancer. It is synthesized as prodomain-growth factor complex that requires tethering to LTBP (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein) for efficient secretion into the extracellular space. Upon release, this large latent complex is sequestered by anchorage to extracellular matrix (ECM) networks, from which the mature growth factor needs to be activated in order to reach its receptors and initiate signaling. Here, we uncovered a novel intracellular secretion pathway by which the latent TGFB1 complex reaches the plasma membrane and is released from fibroblasts, the key effector cells during tissue repair, fibrosis and in the tumor stroma. We show that secretion of latent TGFB1, but not of other selected cytokines or of bulk cargo, is regulated by fibroblast-ECM communication through ILK (integrin linked kinase) that restricts RHOA activity by interacting with ARHGAP26/GRAF1. Latent TGFB1 interacts with GORASP2/GRASP55 and is detected inside MAP1LC3-positive autophagosomal intermediates that are secreted by a RAB8A-dependent pathway. Interestingly, TGFB1 secretion is fully abrogated in human and murine fibroblasts and macrophages that lack key components of the autophagic machinery. Our data demonstrate an unconventional secretion mode of TGFB1 adding another level of control of its bioavailability and activity in order to effectively orchestrate cellular programs prone to dysregulation as seen in fibrosis and cancer.

%X As a consequence of impaired glucose or fatty acid metabolism, bioenergetic stress in skeletal muscles may trigger myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Genetic mutations causing loss of function of the LPIN1 gene frequently lead to severe rhabdomyolysis bouts in children, though the metabolic alterations and possible therapeutic interventions remain elusive. Here, we show that lipin1 deficiency in mouse skeletal muscles is sufficient to trigger myopathy. Strikingly, muscle fibers display strong accumulation of both neutral and phospholipids. The metabolic lipid imbalance can be traced to an altered fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, accompanied by a defect in acyl chain elongation and desaturation. As an underlying cause, we reveal a severe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stress, leading to the activation of the lipogenic SREBP1c/SREBP2 factors, the accumulation of the Fgf21 cytokine, and alterations of SR-mitochondria morphology. Importantly, pharmacological treatments with the chaperone TUDCA and the fatty acid oxidation activator bezafibrate improve muscle histology and strength of lipin1 mutants. Our data reveal that SR stress and alterations in SR-mitochondria contacts are contributing factors and potential intervention targets of the myopathy associated with lipin1 deficiency.

%X Intramembrane-cleaving peptidases of the rhomboid family regulate diverse cellular processes that are critical for development and cell survival. The function of the rhomboid protease PARL in the mitochondrial inner membrane has been linked to mitophagy and apoptosis, but other regulatory functions are likely to exist. Here, we identify the START domain-containing protein STARD7 as an intramitochondrial lipid transfer protein for phosphatidylcholine. We demonstrate that PARL-mediated cleavage during mitochondrial import partitions STARD7 to the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Negatively charged amino acids in STARD7 serve as a sorting signal allowing mitochondrial release of mature STARD7 upon cleavage by PARL On the other hand, membrane insertion of STARD7 mediated by the TIM23 complex promotes mitochondrial localization of mature STARD7. Mitochondrial STARD7 is necessary and sufficient for the accumulation of phosphatidylcholine in the inner membrane and for the maintenance of respiration and cristae morphogenesis. Thus, PARL preserves mitochondrial membrane homeostasis via STARD7 processing and is emerging as a critical regulator of protein localization between mitochondria and the cytosol.

%X Mutations in mitochondrial acylglycerol kinase (AGK) cause Sengers syndrome, which is characterized by cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and skeletal myopathy. AGK generates phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid, bioactive phospholipids involved in lipid signaling and the regulation of tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms of the mitochondrial pathology remain enigmatic. Determining its mitochondrial interactome, we have identified AGK as a constituent of the TIM22 complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane. AGK assembles with TIMM22 and TIMM29 and supports the import of a subset of multi-spanning membrane proteins. The function of AGK as a subunit of the TIM22 complex does not depend on its kinase activity. However, enzymatically active AGK is required to maintain mitochondrial cristae morphogenesis and the apoptotic resistance of cells. The dual function of AGK as lipid kinase and constituent of the TIM22 complex reveals that disturbances in both phospholipid metabolism and mitochondrial protein biogenesis contribute to the pathogenesis of Sengers syndrome.

%X Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. We demonstrate that in mice obesity promotes expansion of a distinct, interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R)a-expressing NK subpopulation, which also expresses a number of other myeloid lineage genes such as the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r). Selective ablation of this Csf1r-expressing NK cell population prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, conditional inactivation of IL6Ra or Stat3 in NK cells limits obesity-associated formation of these myeloid signature NK cells, protecting from obesity, insulin resistance, and obesity-associated inflammation. Also in humans IL6Ra+ NK cells increase in obesity and correlate with markers of systemic low-grade inflammation, and their gene expression profile overlaps with characteristic gene sets of NK cells in obese mice. Collectively, we demonstrate that obesity-associated inflammation and metabolic disturbances depend on interleukin-6/Stat3-dependent formation of a distinct NK population, which may provide a target for the treatment of obesity, metaflammation-associated pathologies, and diabetes.

%X Gut bacteria occupy the interface between the organism and the external environment, contributing to homeostasis and disease. Yet, the causal role of the gut microbiota during host aging is largely unexplored. Here, using the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), a naturally short-lived vertebrate, we show that the gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating vertebrate life span. Recolonizing the gut of middle-age individuals with bacteria from young donors resulted in life span extension and delayed behavioral decline. This intervention prevented the decrease in microbial diversity associated with host aging and maintained a young-like gut bacterial community, characterized by overrepresentation of the key genera Exiguobacterium, Planococcus, Propionigenium and Psychrobacter. Our findings demonstrate that the natural microbial gut community of young individuals can causally induce long-lasting beneficial systemic effects that lead to life span extension in a vertebrate model.

%X OBJECTIVE: Maternal obesity and a disturbed metabolic environment during pregnancy and lactation have been shown to result in many long-term health consequences for the offspring. Among them, impairments in neurocognitive development and performance belong to the most dreaded ones. So far, very few mechanistic approaches have aimed to determine the responsible molecular events. METHODS: In a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity and perinatal hyperinsulinemia, we assessed adult offspring's hippocampal insulin signaling as well as concurrent effects on markers of hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and function using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In search for a potential link between neuronal insulin resistance and hippocampal plasticity, we additionally quantified protein expression of key molecules of synaptic plasticity in an in vitro model of acute neuronal insulin resistance. RESULTS: Maternal obesity and perinatal hyperinsulinemia result in adult hippocampal insulin resistance with subsequently reduced hippocampal mTor signaling and altered expression of markers of neurogenesis (doublecortin), synaptic plasticity (FoxO1, pSynapsin) and function (vGlut, vGAT) in the offspring. The observed effects are independent of the offspring's adult metabolic phenotype and can be associated with multiple previously reported behavioral abnormalities. Additionally, we demonstrate that induction of insulin resistance in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces mTor signaling, doublecortin and vGAT protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal insulin resistance might play a key role in mediating the long-term effects of maternal obesity and perinatal hyperinsulinemia on hippocampal plasticity and the offspring's neurocognitive outcome.

%X The molecular mechanisms regulating animal tissue size during development are unclear. This question has been extensively studied in the Drosophila wing disc. Although cell growth is regulated by the kinase TORC1, no readout exists to visualize TORC1 activity in situ in Drosophila. Both the cell cycle and the morphogen Dpp are linked to tissue growth, but whether they regulate TORC1 activity is not known. We develop here an anti-phospho-dRpS6 antibody that detects TORC1 activity in situ. We find, unexpectedly, that TORC1 activity in the wing disc is patchy. This is caused by elevated TORC1 activity at the cell cycle G1/S transition due to CycD/Cdk4 phosphorylating TSC1/2. We find that TORC1 is also activated independently of CycD/Cdk4 when cells with different levels of Dpp signaling or Brinker protein are juxtaposed. We thereby characterize the spatial distribution of TORC1 activity in a developing organ.

%X Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration barrier. They are subjected to physiological filtration pressure and considerable mechanical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney diseases. When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alterations of these cells, the filtration barrier may become compromised and allow proteins to leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the activity of the transcriptional coactivator YAP and the expression of YAP target genes in a rat model of glomerular disease before the development of proteinuria. Although the activities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are activated by mechanical stress in most cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ activity in cultured human and mouse podocyte cell lines grown on stiff substrates. Culturing these cells on soft matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the damage-induced YAP up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a mechanotransduction-dependent mechanism of YAP activation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix-related proteins that can contribute to fibrosis. YAP activity was increased in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP target CTGF was highly expressed in renal biopsies from glomerular disease patients. Although overexpression of human YAP in mice induced mild proteinuria, pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between YAP and its partner TEAD in rats ameliorated glomerular disease and reduced damage-induced mechanosignaling in the glomeruli. Thus, perturbation of YAP-dependent mechanosignaling is a potential therapeutic target for treating some glomerular diseases.

%X Drosophila melanogaster has been a key model in developing our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ageing. Of particular note is its role in establishing the evolutionary conservation of reduced insulin and IGF-1-like signaling in promoting healthy ageing. Capitalizing on its many advantages for experimentation, more recent work has revealed how precise nutritional and genetic interventions can improve fly lifespan without obvious detrimental side effects. We give a brief summary of these recent findings as well as examples of how they may modify ageing via actions in the gut and muscle. These discoveries highlight how expanding our understanding of metabolic and signaling interconnections will provide even greater insight into how these benefits may be harnessed for anti-ageing interventions.

%X Ribosome profiling via high-throughput sequencing (ribo-seq) is a promising new technique for characterizing the occupancy of ribosomes on messenger RNA (mRNA) at base-pair resolution. The ribosome is responsible for translating mRNA into proteins, so information about its occupancy offers a detailed view of ribosome density and position which could be used to discover new translated open reading frames (ORFs), among other things. In this work, we propose Rp-Bp, an unsupervised Bayesian approach to predict translated ORFs from ribosome profiles. We use state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate posterior distributions of the likelihood of translation of each ORF. Hence, an important feature of Rp-Bp is its ability to incorporate and propagate uncertainty in the prediction process. A second novel contribution is automatic Bayesian selection of read lengths and ribosome P-site offsets (BPPS). We empirically demonstrate that our read length selection technique modestly improves sensitivity by identifying more canonical and non-canonical ORFs. Proteomics- and quantitative translation initiation sequencing-based validation verifies the high quality of all of the predictions. Experimental comparison shows that Rp-Bp results in more peptide identifications and proteomics-validated ORF predictions compared to another recent tool for translation prediction.

%X Mitochondria were first postulated to contribute to aging more than 40 years ago. During the following decades, multiple lines of evidence in model organisms and humans showed that impaired mitochondrial function can contribute to age-associated disease phenotypes and aging. However, in contrast to the original theory favoring oxidative damage as a cause for mtDNA mutations, there are now strong data arguing that most mammalian mtDNA mutations originate as replication errors made by the mtDNA polymerase. Currently, a substantial amount of mitochondrial research is focused on finding ways to either remove or counteract the effects of mtDNA mutations with the hope of extending the human health- and lifespan. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the formation of mtDNA mutations and their impact on mitochondrial function. We also critically discuss proposed pathways interlinked with mammalian mtDNA mutations and suggest future research strategies to elucidate the role of mtDNA mutations in aging.

%X Mutations of mtDNA cause mitochondrial diseases and are implicated in age-associated diseases and aging. Pathogenic mtDNA mutations are often present in a fraction of all mtDNA copies, and it has been widely debated whether the proportion of mutant genomes or the absolute number of wild-type molecules determines if oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) will be impaired. Here, we have studied the male infertility phenotype of mtDNA mutator mice and demonstrate that decreasing mtDNA copy number worsens mitochondrial aberrations of spermatocytes and spermatids in testes, whereas an increase in mtDNA copy number rescues the fertility phenotype and normalizes testes morphology as well as spermatocyte proteome changes. The restoration of testes function occurs in spite of unaltered total mtDNA mutation load. We thus demonstrate that increased copy number of mtDNA can efficiently ameliorate a severe disease phenotype caused by mtDNA mutations, which has important implications for developing future strategies for treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction.

%X Reprogramming of human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has greatly expanded the set of research tools available to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Realizing the promise of iPS cell technology for the identification of novel therapeutic targets and for high-throughput drug screening requires implementation of methods for the large-scale production of defined CNS cell types. Here we describe a protocol for generating stable, highly expandable, iPS cell-derived CNS neural progenitor cells (NPC) using multi-dimensional fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify NPC defined by cell surface markers. In addition, we describe a rapid, efficient, and reproducible method for generating excitatory cortical-like neurons from these NPC through inducible expression of the pro-neural transcription factor Neurogenin 2 (iNgn2-NPC). Finally, we describe methodology for the use of iNgn2-NPC for probing human neuroplasticity and mechanisms underlying CNS disorders using high-content, single-cell-level automated microscopy assays.

%X Mitochondria harbor the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which under aerobic conditions produces the bulk of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The mitochondrial genome encodes key components of the OXPHOS system, and it is transcribed by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, POLRMT. The levels of mitochondrial transcription correlate with the respiratory activity of the cell. Therefore, compounds that can increase or decrease mitochondrial gene transcription may be useful for fine-tuning metabolism and could be used to treat metabolic diseases or certain forms of cancer. We here report the establishment of a novel high-throughput assay technology that has allowed us to screen a library of 430,000 diverse compounds for effects on mitochondrial transcription in vitro. Following secondary screens facilitated by the same assay principle, we identified 55 compounds that efficiently and selectively inhibit mitochondrial transcription and that are active also in cell culture. Our method is easily adaptable to other RNA or DNA polymerases and varying spectroscopic detection technologies.
